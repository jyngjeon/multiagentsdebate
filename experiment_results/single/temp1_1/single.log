Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two players, A and B, who are playing a game with a fair coin. They choose two different patterns: HTH for player A and HHT for player B. They flip the coin repeatedly, and whoever's pattern appears first wins. We need to find the probability that player B wins, meaning HHT appears before HTH in the sequence of flips.

Hmm, I remember that this is a problem related to probability and Markov chains, or maybe using states to model the progress towards each pattern. Let me think. When dealing with such problems, it's often useful to consider the different states that represent the current progress towards each pattern. Each state represents the last few flips, since the patterns can overlap in certain ways.

So the patterns here are HTH and HHT. Let's start by considering the possible states. Each state can be represented by the last few flips that are relevant for either pattern. For HTH, the pattern is three characters long, and similarly for HHT. But since they are of the same length, maybe we need to track the progress of both patterns simultaneously.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using states based on the progress towards each pattern. For example, when trying to reach HTH, the states could be:

- Start: No relevant flips yet.
- H: The last flip was H.
- HT: The last two flips were H then T.
- HTH: The pattern HTH has been achieved (absorbing state for player A).

Similarly for HHT:

- Start: No relevant flips yet.
- H: The last flip was H.
- HH: The last two flips were H then H.
- HHT: The pattern HHT has been achieved (absorbing state for player B).

But since both patterns are being considered, the states need to track progress towards both. Wait, but the game ends when either pattern is completed. So perhaps we need to model the states that track the progress towards either pattern.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of competing patterns. I recall that there's a formula or method to calculate the probability that one pattern occurs before another, which involves considering the probabilities of transitions between different states.

Another approach is to use recursion and set up equations based on the probabilities from each state.

Let me try to define the states based on the progress towards each pattern. Let me consider the current suffix of the flip sequence. For example, after each flip, the state can be the maximum number of characters that match the beginning of either pattern. Since both patterns are three characters long, the possible states are based on how many characters have been matched so far for each pattern.

But since the game ends when either HTH or HHT is found, the states can be:

- Start: No progress on either pattern.
- H: The last flip is H, which is the first character of both HTH and HHT.
- HT: The last two flips are H then T. This is the first two characters of HTH but not HHT.
- HH: The last two flips are H then H. This is the first two characters of HHT but not HTH.
- TH: The last flip is T following an H, which might be part of HTH if the previous was H. Wait, maybe I need a more systematic way.

Alternatively, think of states as the current progress towards HTH and HHT. Let me consider all possible combinations. However, this might get complex because the progress for each pattern can be tracked separately. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

I remember that in similar problems, such as the "Penney's game," the probability of one pattern appearing before another can be calculated by considering the overlaps and using states. For example, in Penney's game, the second player can choose a pattern that has a higher probability of appearing first.

In this case, HHT vs HTH. I think there's a known result for this. Let me recall. From Penney's game, the probabilities for these two patterns: HHT has a higher chance of appearing before HTH. But I need to calculate the exact probability.

Let me try to model this using states. Let me define states based on the progress towards HTH and HHT. Let's think about the possible states as the current sequence that could lead to either pattern.

Let me consider the possible states as follows:

State S: No relevant flips yet (start).

State H: Last flip was H.

State HH: Last two flips were HH.

State HT: Last two flips were HT.

State TH: Last flip was T after an H? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think of states based on the maximum progress towards each pattern.

Alternatively, think of the state as the current suffix of the flip sequence that can contribute to either pattern. For example, after a flip, depending on what was flipped, we can transition between states.

Let me try setting up equations. Let me denote the probability that B wins (i.e., HHT occurs before HTH) starting from each state.

Let me define the states as follows:

- State S: Start state, no progress towards either pattern.
- State H: The last flip was H.
- State HH: The last two flips were HH.
- State HT: The last two flips were HT.
- State TH: The last flip was T (but this might be part of HTH if followed by H).

Wait, maybe I need to track the progress for both patterns. However, since the game ends when either HTH or HHT is achieved, we can model the states as the progress towards each of these patterns.

Alternatively, since both patterns are three characters, let's track the progress towards each. For example, when trying to get HTH, the progress can be 0, 1, or 2 characters matched. Similarly for HHT.

But since the progress for each pattern can be tracked separately, but the game is about which occurs first, this might get complicated. Maybe we can think of the possible states as combinations of progress towards both patterns, but perhaps some states can be merged if they can't be in the same situation.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that once you start building towards one pattern, certain flips might reset progress for the other.

Alternatively, think of the problem as a Markov chain with states representing the current "context" of the last flips that are relevant for either pattern.

Let me try again with states:

Start (S): No progress.

After the first flip, it's either H or T. Let's see:

From S:

- On H: go to state H.
- On T: stay in S, since T doesn't help HTH or HHT.

From state H:

- Next flip H: go to state HH (since we have two Hs, which is the start of HHT).
- Next flip T: go to state HT (the start of HTH: H followed by T).

From state HH:

- Next flip T: we get HHT, which is player B's pattern. So B wins.
- Next flip H: we have HHH, which might be part of something else. But HHH's last two flips are HH, so we stay in state HH? Wait, no. Wait, if the last two flips are HH, then the next flip is H, making the last two flips as HH again (since the last two are the last two flips: if the previous state was HH, and we add an H, the new state is H (the last flip is H, but the previous was also H). Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the state should represent the progress towards each pattern. If the current state is HH (i.e., the last two flips are HH), then:

- If we flip a T, then the last two flips are HT, but that might be relevant for HTH. Wait, no: the last two flips would be H (from the previous HH) followed by T. Wait, if we are in state HH (last two flips are HH), and we flip a T, then the last two flips are HT (the previous H and the new T). So the state would transition to HT. But HT is the first two characters of HTH, so that's progress towards HTH. Alternatively, the state after flipping T from HH is HT, which is a state where the last two flips are HT.

But then, from state HT:

- If we flip H, then we have HTH, which is player A's pattern, so A wins.
- If we flip T, then the last two flips are TT, which doesn't contribute to either pattern. So we might go back to S or some other state?

Wait, no. Wait, if the last two flips were HT and we flip a T, the new last two flips are T and T (the last two are TT). But in terms of progress towards the patterns, TT is not the start of either HTH or HHT. So from state HT, on flipping a T, we go to state T? Or maybe state S again?

Wait, perhaps I need to define states based on the progress towards the patterns. Let's consider the possible states based on the relevant suffix that can contribute to either pattern. For HTH, the relevant suffixes are H, HT, and HTH. For HHT, the relevant suffixes are H, HH, and HHT. However, when a flip occurs, the state transitions based on the current suffix.

But to model this, perhaps the states are:

- S: start state (no progress)
- H: last flip was H
- HH: last two flips were HH
- HT: last two flips were HT
- TH: last flip was T (but this might be part of HTH if followed by H)
Wait, no. TH isn't part of HHT. Hmm. Maybe I need to track the maximum progress towards each pattern.

Alternatively, consider that after each flip, the state is determined by the maximum number of characters matched for each pattern. But since the game ends when either pattern is matched, maybe we can model the states as combinations of progress towards each.

This seems complex. Let me look for a better approach.

Another way: use the concept of expected waiting times or recursive probability equations.

Let me define P(s) as the probability that player B wins starting from state s.

Our goal is to find P(S), the probability starting from the initial state.

Let me consider the states as follows:

- S: start state (no progress)
- H: last flip was H
- HH: last two flips were HH
- HT: last two flips were HT
- TH: last flip was T (but how does this fit? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.)

Wait, when you're in state H, and you flip a T, you go to HT. If you flip another H, you go to HH. From HT, if you flip an H, then you get HTH (player A wins). If you flip a T, then the last two flips are TT, which doesn't contribute to either pattern, so we might be in a state where we have to consider the last flip as T, but that doesn't contribute to HTH or HHT. But how to model that?

Wait, maybe I need to consider states that are the last 2 flips, since both patterns are of length 3. Because the outcome of the next flip depends on the last few flips. So let's consider states as the last two flips, or less if there are not enough.

So possible states:

- S (start): no flips or less than two flips.

- H: last flip is H.

- T: last flip is T.

- HH: last two flips are HH.

- HT: last two flips are HT.

- TH: last two flips are TH.

- TT: last two flips are TT.

But wait, since HTH is three characters, and HHT is three characters, the progress towards these patterns depends on the last two flips. For example, if the last two flips are HT, then the next flip being H would complete HTH. If the last two flips are HH, then the next flip being T would complete HHT.

So let's model the states as the last one or two flips, up to two, since three flips would trigger the end.

So the possible non-terminal states are:

S (no progress), H, T, HH, HT, TH, TT. Wait, but S might be equivalent to T? Or maybe S is the initial state where no flips have occurred, and after one flip, we're in H or T. But perhaps S is redundant once we have H and T. However, for consistency, maybe we can model S as the state before any flips.

But to avoid confusion, let's define the states as:

- S: initial state (no flips yet)

- H: last flip is H

- T: last flip is T

- HH: last two flips are HH

- HT: last two flips are HT

- TH: last two flips are TH

- TT: last two flips are TT

But note that once we have a sequence of three flips that completes either HTH or HHT, the game ends.

Now, starting from S, the first flip can be H or T, each with 0.5 probability.

From state S:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → go to state H

- Flip T (prob 0.5) → go to state T

From state H:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → new state is HH (last two flips are HH)

- Flip T (prob 0.5) → new state is HT (last two flips are HT)

From state T:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → new state is TH (last two flips are TH)

- Flip T (prob 0.5) → new state is TT (last two flips are TT)

From state HH:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → new state is HH (last two flips are HH, since previous was HH and now H, so the last two are HH again?)

Wait, no. If the last two flips were HH, and we flip another H, the new last two flips are HH again (the previous H and the new H). So from state HH, flipping H keeps us in HH. If we flip T, then the last two flips are HT, so go to state HT.

But if we're in state HH and flip a T, then the last two flips are HT, which is state HT. And in that case, if the previous state was HH and we flip T, then the sequence is HHT, which is player B's pattern. Wait, so the last three flips would be HH followed by T, making HHT. So that's the end, and B wins.

Ah, that's crucial. So when in state HH and we flip a T, we immediately get HHT, so B wins. Similarly, from state HT, if we flip an H, then the last three flips are HTH (HT from previous state plus H), so A wins.

So that's the key: when transitioning from a state, some transitions lead directly to a win.

So let's redefine the transitions properly, considering when the next flip completes a pattern.

Let me adjust the states and transitions accordingly.

Starting with state S.

State S:

- On H → H

- On T → T

State H:

- On H → HH (since the last two are HH)

- On T → HT (last two are HT)

State T:

- On H → TH (last two are TH)

- On T → TT (last two are TT)

State HH:

- On H → HH (since the last two flips are still HH)

- On T → HHT (which is B's pattern; B wins)

State HT:

- On H → HTH (which is A's pattern; A wins)

- On T → T (the last flip is T, but since the previous state was HT (last two flips HT), flipping a T would make the last two flips TT, so go to state TT.

Wait, but the last two flips would be T (from the previous state's last flip being T?) Wait, the state HT represents the last two flips being HT. If we then flip a T, the new last two flips are T and T. So the new state is TT. Therefore, from state HT, on T, go to TT.

Similarly, state TH:

- On H: previous state is TH (last two flips TH), flip H → the last two flips are HH, so state HH

- On T: previous state is TH, flip T → last two flips are HT (T from previous and H? Wait, no. Wait, the last two flips were TH. If we flip a T now, the new last two flips are H followed by T? No, the previous last two were TH, which is the last two flips: T and H. If we flip another T, the new last two flips are H and T? Wait, no. Wait, the previous last two flips are TH (T and H). Then, flipping a T, the new sequence ends with H and T? No, the last two flips would be the last two flips of the entire sequence. If the last two were TH and we add a T, the new last two flips are H and T (the previous H and new T)? Wait no. Wait, the entire sequence is ...TH, then adding a T makes the last two flips as HT? Wait no. If the previous last two flips were TH (i.e., the penultimate flip was T, the last was H), then adding another T makes the last two flips H and T? No. Wait, no: the previous last two were T (position n-1) and H (position n). Adding a T at position n+1, the last two flips are now H (position n) and T (position n+1), so HT. So from TH, flipping a T leads to state HT.

Similarly, flipping H from TH (last two flips TH) would result in the new last two flips being H (previous H) and H (new H)? Wait, no. Wait, previous last two flips were T and H. Adding an H, the new last two flips are H (from the previous last flip, H) and H (the new flip). So the state is HH.

Therefore, state TH transitions:

- On H → HH

- On T → HT

Similarly, state TT:

- On H → TH (last two flips are TT, then H → last two are TH)

- On T → TT (last two flips remain TT)

Now, with these transitions, we can define the probabilities.

Let me denote P(s) as the probability that B wins starting from state s.

We need to find P(S).

We can write the following equations based on the transitions:

For state S:

P(S) = 0.5 * P(H) + 0.5 * P(T)

For state H:

P(H) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)

For state T:

P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

For state HH:

From state HH, flipping H leads to HH again, and flipping T leads to B winning.

Thus:

P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1

Because with probability 0.5, we stay in HH, and with 0.5, we get B's pattern (so B wins with probability 1).

For state HT:

From state HT, flipping H leads to A winning (so B's probability is 0), and flipping T leads to state TT.

Thus:

P(HT) = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TT)

For state TH:

From state TH, flipping H leads to state HH, and flipping T leads to state HT.

Thus:

P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)

For state TT:

From state TT, flipping H leads to state TH, and flipping T leads to state TT.

Thus:

P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

Now, we have a system of equations:

1. P(S) = 0.5 * P(H) + 0.5 * P(T)
2. P(H) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)
3. P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)
4. P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1
5. P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT)
6. P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)
7. P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

Starting with equation 4:

Equation 4: P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1

Subtract 0.5 * P(HH) from both sides:

0.5 * P(HH) = 0.5 * 1 → P(HH) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. If P(HH) = 1, that means that from state HH, the probability B wins is 1? But that seems incorrect. Because from state HH, there's a 50% chance to stay in HH and 50% to get HHT (B wins). However, equation 4 suggests that P(HH) = 1. Let me check:

Equation 4:

P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1

So rearranged:

P(HH) - 0.5 P(HH) = 0.5 → 0.5 P(HH) = 0.5 → P(HH) = 1. So yes, according to the equation, that's correct. Because even though there's a possibility to loop back to HH, the expected value converges to 1. Because eventually, with probability 1, you'll eventually get a T, which leads to B's win. So P(HH) = 1.

So from state HH, B will win with probability 1. That makes sense, since the process is guaranteed to eventually reach HHT from HH.

Now, moving to equation 5: P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT)

Equation 6: P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT)

Equation 7: P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

Rearranging equation 7:

P(TT) - 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) → 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) → P(TT) = P(TH)

So equation 7 simplifies to P(TT) = P(TH)

Now, from equation 6: P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT)

But from equation 5, P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT). And since P(TT) = P(TH), we can substitute:

P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TH)

Then equation 6 becomes:

P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5 * (0.5 * P(TH)) = 0.5 + 0.25 * P(TH)

Rearranging:

P(TH) - 0.25 P(TH) = 0.5 → 0.75 P(TH) = 0.5 → P(TH) = 0.5 / 0.75 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667

Since P(TT) = P(TH), then P(TT) = 2/3

From equation 5, P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * (2/3) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333

Now, moving to equation 3: P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

But since P(TH) = P(TT) = 2/3:

P(T) = 0.5*(2/3) + 0.5*(2/3) = 2/3

So P(T) = 2/3

Next, equation 2: P(H) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (1/3) = 0.5 + 1/6 = 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333

Then, equation 1: P(S) = 0.5 * P(H) + 0.5 * P(T) = 0.5*(5/6) + 0.5*(2/3) = (5/12) + (1/3) = 5/12 + 4/12 = 9/12 = 3/4 = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that player B wins is 3/4 or 0.75.

Wait, but let me check this result. According to Penney's game, HHT has a higher probability than HTH, and this result says 75% chance for B (HHT). That seems correct. For example, in Penney's game, the probability of HHT coming before HTH is 2/3? Wait no, but according to this calculation, it's 3/4. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, I can recall that for the patterns HHT vs HTH, the probability that HHT occurs before HTH is 2/3. Hmm, but according to my equations, it's 3/4. There's a contradiction here, which suggests I might have made an error in the equations.

Let me recheck the equations.

Equation for P(HH) = 1. That's correct because from state HH, eventually, you will get a T with probability 1, leading to HHT, so B wins.

Equation 5: P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT)

Equation 6: P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5*1 + 0.5*P(HT) = 0.5 + 0.5*P(HT)

Equation 7: P(TT) = P(TH)

Then, equation for P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT). And since P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH), substituting:

P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5*(0.5 * P(TH)) → P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.25*P(TH)

Then, 0.75 P(TH) = 0.5 → P(TH) = 0.5 / 0.75 = 2/3. Correct.

Then, P(TT) = 2/3.

Then P(HT) = 0.5 * 2/3 = 1/3.

Then P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5*(2/3) + 0.5*(2/3) = 2/3. Correct.

Then P(H) = 0.5*P(HH) + 0.5*P(HT) = 0.5*1 + 0.5*(1/3) = 0.5 + 1/6 = 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6. Correct.

Then P(S) = 0.5*P(H) + 0.5*P(T) = 0.5*(5/6) + 0.5*(2/3) = 5/12 + 2/6 = 5/12 + 4/12 = 9/12 = 3/4. So 0.75.

But according to my knowledge from Penney's game, the probability that HHT comes before HTH is 2/3. Wait, but I need to verify this.

Wait, according to the Penney's game probabilities, for the pair HHT vs HTH, the probability of HHT occurring before HTH is 2/3. For example, the probability that HHT appears before HTH in a fair coin flip is 2/3. However, my calculation here says 3/4, which conflicts. So where is the mistake?

Let me check the setup of the equations again. Perhaps I missed some state transitions.

Let me consider a simple case. For example, starting from state S, let's simulate.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the definition of the states. For example, when we're in state HT, and we flip a T, we go to state TT. But what about the possibility of overlapping patterns?

Alternatively, let's use another method. Let me recall that for competing patterns, the probability can be found using the formula involving the odds of the patterns.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, use recursion with the equations again, but double-checking the transitions.

Let me think about a specific example: starting from S, what is the probability?

Suppose the first flip is H (prob 0.5), then we're in state H. From H, next flip is H or T. If it's H, go to HH. If T, go to HT.

From HH, as we said, P(HH) = 1.

From HT, there's a 0.5 chance to get A's win (H) or go to TT.

From TT, you have to go through TH or stay in TT.

Wait, but maybe there's an error in the equation for P(TH). Let me check the equation for P(TH). When in TH, flipping H leads to HH, and flipping T leads to HT. Thus:

P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (0.5 * P(TT)) → wait no, earlier we had P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT). So substituting:

P(TH) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (0.5 * P(TT)) = 0.5 + 0.25 * P(TT). But earlier, we had from equation 7 that P(TT) = P(TH). So substituting:

P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.25 * P(TH)

Which gives:

P(TH) - 0.25 P(TH) = 0.5 → 0.75 P(TH) = 0.5 → P(TH) = 2/3, which matches earlier result. So that seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought P(TH) was 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT), but P(HT) is 0.5 * P(TT), and since P(TT) = P(TH), that gives 0.5 + 0.5*(0.5*P(TH)) = 0.5 + 0.25 P(TH). So that's correct.

Thus, the calculation seems correct. Then why does it differ from my recollection of Penney's game? Let me check a reference.

Upon checking, in Penney's game, the probability that HHT occurs before HTH is indeed 2/3. So why does this calculation give 3/4? There must be a mistake in the state definitions or transitions.

Let me try another approach. Let me simulate the probabilities using the equations again, but perhaps I made an error in the equations.

Wait, another way: Let me consider that from state S, the probability that B wins is P(S) = 3/4. If that's true, then the probability that B wins is 3/4, and A wins with probability 1/4. But according to Penney's game, it should be 2/3 for B and 1/3 for A. So there's inconsistency.

Let me check another source. According to the Penney's game, the probability of HHT occurring before HTH is 2/3. Here's a way to calculate it using states:

The states are defined differently. Let me consider the following states:

- Start (S)

- H

- HH

- HT

- TH

- T

Now, using absorbing states for HTH and HHT.

Let me define the probabilities again, but maybe with different state transitions.

Alternatively, I can refer to the Markov chain approach. Let me try to model this correctly.

Another resource says that for two patterns A and B, the probability that B occurs before A can be found using the formula:

P(B wins) = (P_A / (P_A + P_B))

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it involves comparing the expected number of trials.

Alternatively, let's refer to the odds of the two patterns. The probability that HHT appears before HTH can be calculated by considering the possible overlaps.

For example, HTH has a self-overlap: if the first two flips are HT, and then a T occurs, it doesn't help towards HTH, but if a H occurs, it completes the pattern. HHT has a self-overlap of HH.

But perhaps the calculation using states is correct, and my previous belief about Penney's game was incorrect. Let me try to find the exact probability for HHT vs HTH.

Another way to calculate this is using the following method from probability theory: the probability that HHT occurs before HTH is equal to the probability that the first occurrence of either pattern is HHT.

Let me think about the problem in terms of the states and the transitions again.

Let me try to calculate P(S) using the equations I had before, which gave 3/4. Let's do a simulation or use another method.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the expected number of steps, but that might not help.

Alternatively, think of the game as follows:

After the first flip, which is H with 0.5, T with 0.5.

If it's T, then we have to wait. If it's H, then we go to state H.

Let me think recursively.

Let me define P as the probability that B wins starting from S.

From S, P = 0.5 * P_H + 0.5 * P_T

Where P_H is the probability from state H, and P_T from state T.

Now, from state H:

P_H = 0.5 * P_HH + 0.5 * P_HT

From state HH:

P_HH = 0.5 * P_HH + 0.5 * 1 → P_HH = 1

From state HT:

P_HT = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * P_TT

From state T:

P_T = 0.5 * P_TH + 0.5 * P_TT

From state TH:

P_TH = 0.5 * P_HH + 0.5 * P_HT = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 *'

--- Question 23/50 ---
Question: Suppose we have a game that assumes we have a fair coin. Two people who are playing can pick two patterns of coin flips. The players then flip a large coin a number of times and record each of the individual flips. Here, H stands for heads and T stands for tails. After the flips, they pay attention to the record of flips and decide which pattern came first in the sequence. If HTH came before HHT, player A won the game, otherwise, B won the game. What is the probability that player B won this game?
Model Raw Answer: <think>
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two players, A and B, who are playing a game with a fair coin. They choose two different patterns: HTH for player A and HHT for player B. They flip the coin repeatedly, and whoever's pattern appears first wins. We need to find the probability that player B wins, meaning HHT appears before HTH in the sequence of flips.

Hmm, I remember that this is a problem related to probability and Markov chains, or maybe using states to model the progress towards each pattern. Let me think. When dealing with such problems, it's often useful to consider the different states that represent the current progress towards each pattern. Each state represents the last few flips, since the patterns can overlap in certain ways.

So the patterns here are HTH and HHT. Let's start by considering the possible states. Each state can be represented by the last few flips that are relevant for either pattern. For HTH, the pattern is three characters long, and similarly for HHT. But since they are of the same length, maybe we need to track the progress of both patterns simultaneously.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using states based on the progress towards each pattern. For example, when trying to reach HTH, the states could be:

- Start: No relevant flips yet.
- H: The last flip was H.
- HT: The last two flips were H then T.
- HTH: The pattern HTH has been achieved (absorbing state for player A).

Similarly for HHT:

- Start: No relevant flips yet.
- H: The last flip was H.
- HH: The last two flips were H then H.
- HHT: The pattern HHT has been achieved (absorbing state for player B).

But since both patterns are being considered, the states need to track progress towards both. Wait, but the game ends when either pattern is completed. So perhaps we need to model the states that track the progress towards either pattern.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of competing patterns. I recall that there's a formula or method to calculate the probability that one pattern occurs before another, which involves considering the probabilities of transitions between different states.

Another approach is to use recursion and set up equations based on the probabilities from each state.

Let me try to define the states based on the progress towards each pattern. Let me consider the current suffix of the flip sequence. For example, after each flip, the state can be the maximum number of characters that match the beginning of either pattern. Since both patterns are three characters long, the possible states are based on how many characters have been matched so far for each pattern.

But since the game ends when either HTH or HHT is found, the states can be:

- Start: No progress on either pattern.
- H: The last flip is H, which is the first character of both HTH and HHT.
- HT: The last two flips are H then T. This is the first two characters of HTH but not HHT.
- HH: The last two flips are H then H. This is the first two characters of HHT but not HTH.
- TH: The last flip is T following an H, which might be part of HTH if the previous was H. Wait, maybe I need a more systematic way.

Alternatively, think of states as the current progress towards HTH and HHT. Let me consider all possible combinations. However, this might get complex because the progress for each pattern can be tracked separately. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

I remember that in similar problems, such as the "Penney's game," the probability of one pattern appearing before another can be calculated by considering the overlaps and using states. For example, in Penney's game, the second player can choose a pattern that has a higher probability of appearing first.

In this case, HHT vs HTH. I think there's a known result for this. Let me recall. From Penney's game, the probabilities for these two patterns: HHT has a higher chance of appearing before HTH. But I need to calculate the exact probability.

Let me try to model this using states. Let me define states based on the progress towards HTH and HHT. Let's think about the possible states as the current sequence that could lead to either pattern.

Let me consider the possible states as follows:

State S: No relevant flips yet (start).

State H: Last flip was H.

State HH: Last two flips were HH.

State HT: Last two flips were HT.

State TH: Last flip was T after an H? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think of states based on the maximum progress towards each pattern.

Alternatively, think of the state as the current suffix of the flip sequence that can contribute to either pattern. For example, after a flip, depending on what was flipped, we can transition between states.

Let me try setting up equations. Let me denote the probability that B wins (i.e., HHT occurs before HTH) starting from each state.

Let me define the states as follows:

- State S: Start state, no progress towards either pattern.
- State H: The last flip was H.
- State HH: The last two flips were HH.
- State HT: The last two flips were HT.
- State TH: The last flip was T (but this might be part of HTH if followed by H).

Wait, maybe I need to track the progress for both patterns. However, since the game ends when either HTH or HHT is achieved, we can model the states as the progress towards each of these patterns.

Alternatively, since both patterns are three characters, let's track the progress towards each. For example, when trying to get HTH, the progress can be 0, 1, or 2 characters matched. Similarly for HHT.

But since the progress for each pattern can be tracked separately, but the game is about which occurs first, this might get complicated. Maybe we can think of the possible states as combinations of progress towards both patterns, but perhaps some states can be merged if they can't be in the same situation.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that once you start building towards one pattern, certain flips might reset progress for the other.

Alternatively, think of the problem as a Markov chain with states representing the current "context" of the last flips that are relevant for either pattern.

Let me try again with states:

Start (S): No progress.

After the first flip, it's either H or T. Let's see:

From S:

- On H: go to state H.
- On T: stay in S, since T doesn't help HTH or HHT.

From state H:

- Next flip H: go to state HH (since we have two Hs, which is the start of HHT).
- Next flip T: go to state HT (the start of HTH: H followed by T).

From state HH:

- Next flip T: we get HHT, which is player B's pattern. So B wins.
- Next flip H: we have HHH, which might be part of something else. But HHH's last two flips are HH, so we stay in state HH? Wait, no. Wait, if the last two flips are HH, then the next flip is H, making the last two flips as HH again (since the last two are the last two flips: if the previous state was HH, and we add an H, the new state is H (the last flip is H, but the previous was also H). Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the state should represent the progress towards each pattern. If the current state is HH (i.e., the last two flips are HH), then:

- If we flip a T, then the last two flips are HT, but that might be relevant for HTH. Wait, no: the last two flips would be H (from the previous HH) followed by T. Wait, if we are in state HH (last two flips are HH), and we flip a T, then the last two flips are HT (the previous H and the new T). So the state would transition to HT. But HT is the first two characters of HTH, so that's progress towards HTH. Alternatively, the state after flipping T from HH is HT, which is a state where the last two flips are HT.

But then, from state HT:

- If we flip H, then we have HTH, which is player A's pattern, so A wins.
- If we flip T, then the last two flips are TT, which doesn't contribute to either pattern. So we might go back to S or some other state?

Wait, no. Wait, if the last two flips were HT and we flip a T, the new last two flips are T and T (the last two are TT). But in terms of progress towards the patterns, TT is not the start of either HTH or HHT. So from state HT, on flipping a T, we go to state T? Or maybe state S again?

Wait, perhaps I need to define states based on the progress towards the patterns. Let's consider the possible states based on the relevant suffix that can contribute to either pattern. For HTH, the relevant suffixes are H, HT, and HTH. For HHT, the relevant suffixes are H, HH, and HHT. However, when a flip occurs, the state transitions based on the current suffix.

But to model this, perhaps the states are:

- S: start state (no progress)
- H: last flip was H
- HH: last two flips were HH
- HT: last two flips were HT
- TH: last flip was T (but this might be part of HTH if followed by H)
Wait, no. TH isn't part of HHT. Hmm. Maybe I need to track the maximum progress towards each pattern.

Alternatively, consider that after each flip, the state is determined by the maximum number of characters matched for each pattern. But since the game ends when either pattern is matched, maybe we can model the states as combinations of progress towards each.

This seems complex. Let me look for a better approach.

Another way: use the concept of expected waiting times or recursive probability equations.

Let me define P(s) as the probability that player B wins starting from state s.

Our goal is to find P(S), the probability starting from the initial state.

Let me consider the states as follows:

- S: start state (no progress)
- H: last flip was H
- HH: last two flips were HH
- HT: last two flips were HT
- TH: last flip was T (but how does this fit? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.)

Wait, when you're in state H, and you flip a T, you go to HT. If you flip another H, you go to HH. From HT, if you flip an H, then you get HTH (player A wins). If you flip a T, then the last two flips are TT, which doesn't contribute to either pattern, so we might be in a state where we have to consider the last flip as T, but that doesn't contribute to HTH or HHT. But how to model that?

Wait, maybe I need to consider states that are the last 2 flips, since both patterns are of length 3. Because the outcome of the next flip depends on the last few flips. So let's consider states as the last two flips, or less if there are not enough.

So possible states:

- S (start): no flips or less than two flips.

- H: last flip is H.

- T: last flip is T.

- HH: last two flips are HH.

- HT: last two flips are HT.

- TH: last two flips are TH.

- TT: last two flips are TT.

But wait, since HTH is three characters, and HHT is three characters, the progress towards these patterns depends on the last two flips. For example, if the last two flips are HT, then the next flip being H would complete HTH. If the last two flips are HH, then the next flip being T would complete HHT.

So let's model the states as the last one or two flips, up to two, since three flips would trigger the end.

So the possible non-terminal states are:

S (no progress), H, T, HH, HT, TH, TT. Wait, but S might be equivalent to T? Or maybe S is the initial state where no flips have occurred, and after one flip, we're in H or T. But perhaps S is redundant once we have H and T. However, for consistency, maybe we can model S as the state before any flips.

But to avoid confusion, let's define the states as:

- S: initial state (no flips yet)

- H: last flip is H

- T: last flip is T

- HH: last two flips are HH

- HT: last two flips are HT

- TH: last two flips are TH

- TT: last two flips are TT

But note that once we have a sequence of three flips that completes either HTH or HHT, the game ends.

Now, starting from S, the first flip can be H or T, each with 0.5 probability.

From state S:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → go to state H

- Flip T (prob 0.5) → go to state T

From state H:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → new state is HH (last two flips are HH)

- Flip T (prob 0.5) → new state is HT (last two flips are HT)

From state T:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → new state is TH (last two flips are TH)

- Flip T (prob 0.5) → new state is TT (last two flips are TT)

From state HH:

- Flip H (prob 0.5) → new state is HH (last two flips are HH, since previous was HH and now H, so the last two are HH again?)

Wait, no. If the last two flips were HH, and we flip another H, the new last two flips are HH again (the previous H and the new H). So from state HH, flipping H keeps us in HH. If we flip T, then the last two flips are HT, so go to state HT.

But if we're in state HH and flip a T, then the last two flips are HT, which is state HT. And in that case, if the previous state was HH and we flip T, then the sequence is HHT, which is player B's pattern. Wait, so the last three flips would be HH followed by T, making HHT. So that's the end, and B wins.

Ah, that's crucial. So when in state HH and we flip a T, we immediately get HHT, so B wins. Similarly, from state HT, if we flip an H, then the last three flips are HTH (HT from previous state plus H), so A wins.

So that's the key: when transitioning from a state, some transitions lead directly to a win.

So let's redefine the transitions properly, considering when the next flip completes a pattern.

Let me adjust the states and transitions accordingly.

Starting with state S.

State S:

- On H → H

- On T → T

State H:

- On H → HH (since the last two are HH)

- On T → HT (last two are HT)

State T:

- On H → TH (last two are TH)

- On T → TT (last two are TT)

State HH:

- On H → HH (since the last two flips are still HH)

- On T → HHT (which is B's pattern; B wins)

State HT:

- On H → HTH (which is A's pattern; A wins)

- On T → T (the last flip is T, but since the previous state was HT (last two flips HT), flipping a T would make the last two flips TT, so go to state TT.

Wait, but the last two flips would be T (from the previous state's last flip being T?) Wait, the state HT represents the last two flips being HT. If we then flip a T, the new last two flips are T and T. So the new state is TT. Therefore, from state HT, on T, go to TT.

Similarly, state TH:

- On H: previous state is TH (last two flips TH), flip H → the last two flips are HH, so state HH

- On T: previous state is TH, flip T → last two flips are HT (T from previous and H? Wait, no. Wait, the last two flips were TH. If we flip a T now, the new last two flips are H followed by T? No, the previous last two were TH, which is the last two flips: T and H. If we flip another T, the new last two flips are H and T? Wait, no. Wait, the previous last two flips are TH (T and H). Then, flipping a T, the new sequence ends with H and T? No, the last two flips would be the last two flips of the entire sequence. If the last two were TH and we add a T, the new last two flips are H and T (the previous H and new T)? Wait no. Wait, the entire sequence is ...TH, then adding a T makes the last two flips as HT? Wait no. If the previous last two flips were TH (i.e., the penultimate flip was T, the last was H), then adding another T makes the last two flips H and T? No. Wait, no: the previous last two were T (position n-1) and H (position n). Adding a T at position n+1, the last two flips are now H (position n) and T (position n+1), so HT. So from TH, flipping a T leads to state HT.

Similarly, flipping H from TH (last two flips TH) would result in the new last two flips being H (previous H) and H (new H)? Wait, no. Wait, previous last two flips were T and H. Adding an H, the new last two flips are H (from the previous last flip, H) and H (the new flip). So the state is HH.

Therefore, state TH transitions:

- On H → HH

- On T → HT

Similarly, state TT:

- On H → TH (last two flips are TT, then H → last two are TH)

- On T → TT (last two flips remain TT)

Now, with these transitions, we can define the probabilities.

Let me denote P(s) as the probability that B wins starting from state s.

We need to find P(S).

We can write the following equations based on the transitions:

For state S:

P(S) = 0.5 * P(H) + 0.5 * P(T)

For state H:

P(H) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)

For state T:

P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

For state HH:

From state HH, flipping H leads to HH again, and flipping T leads to B winning.

Thus:

P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1

Because with probability 0.5, we stay in HH, and with 0.5, we get B's pattern (so B wins with probability 1).

For state HT:

From state HT, flipping H leads to A winning (so B's probability is 0), and flipping T leads to state TT.

Thus:

P(HT) = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TT)

For state TH:

From state TH, flipping H leads to state HH, and flipping T leads to state HT.

Thus:

P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)

For state TT:

From state TT, flipping H leads to state TH, and flipping T leads to state TT.

Thus:

P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

Now, we have a system of equations:

1. P(S) = 0.5 * P(H) + 0.5 * P(T)
2. P(H) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)
3. P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)
4. P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1
5. P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT)
6. P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT)
7. P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

Starting with equation 4:

Equation 4: P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1

Subtract 0.5 * P(HH) from both sides:

0.5 * P(HH) = 0.5 * 1 → P(HH) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. If P(HH) = 1, that means that from state HH, the probability B wins is 1? But that seems incorrect. Because from state HH, there's a 50% chance to stay in HH and 50% to get HHT (B wins). However, equation 4 suggests that P(HH) = 1. Let me check:

Equation 4:

P(HH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * 1

So rearranged:

P(HH) - 0.5 P(HH) = 0.5 → 0.5 P(HH) = 0.5 → P(HH) = 1. So yes, according to the equation, that's correct. Because even though there's a possibility to loop back to HH, the expected value converges to 1. Because eventually, with probability 1, you'll eventually get a T, which leads to B's win. So P(HH) = 1.

So from state HH, B will win with probability 1. That makes sense, since the process is guaranteed to eventually reach HHT from HH.

Now, moving to equation 5: P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT)

Equation 6: P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT)

Equation 7: P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

Rearranging equation 7:

P(TT) - 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) → 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH) → P(TT) = P(TH)

So equation 7 simplifies to P(TT) = P(TH)

Now, from equation 6: P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT)

But from equation 5, P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT). And since P(TT) = P(TH), we can substitute:

P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TH)

Then equation 6 becomes:

P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5 * (0.5 * P(TH)) = 0.5 + 0.25 * P(TH)

Rearranging:

P(TH) - 0.25 P(TH) = 0.5 → 0.75 P(TH) = 0.5 → P(TH) = 0.5 / 0.75 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667

Since P(TT) = P(TH), then P(TT) = 2/3

From equation 5, P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * (2/3) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333

Now, moving to equation 3: P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT)

But since P(TH) = P(TT) = 2/3:

P(T) = 0.5*(2/3) + 0.5*(2/3) = 2/3

So P(T) = 2/3

Next, equation 2: P(H) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (1/3) = 0.5 + 1/6 = 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333

Then, equation 1: P(S) = 0.5 * P(H) + 0.5 * P(T) = 0.5*(5/6) + 0.5*(2/3) = (5/12) + (1/3) = 5/12 + 4/12 = 9/12 = 3/4 = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that player B wins is 3/4 or 0.75.

Wait, but let me check this result. According to Penney's game, HHT has a higher probability than HTH, and this result says 75% chance for B (HHT). That seems correct. For example, in Penney's game, the probability of HHT coming before HTH is 2/3? Wait no, but according to this calculation, it's 3/4. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, I can recall that for the patterns HHT vs HTH, the probability that HHT occurs before HTH is 2/3. Hmm, but according to my equations, it's 3/4. There's a contradiction here, which suggests I might have made an error in the equations.

Let me recheck the equations.

Equation for P(HH) = 1. That's correct because from state HH, eventually, you will get a T with probability 1, leading to HHT, so B wins.

Equation 5: P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT)

Equation 6: P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5*1 + 0.5*P(HT) = 0.5 + 0.5*P(HT)

Equation 7: P(TT) = P(TH)

Then, equation for P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT). And since P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5 * P(TH), substituting:

P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.5*(0.5 * P(TH)) → P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.25*P(TH)

Then, 0.75 P(TH) = 0.5 → P(TH) = 0.5 / 0.75 = 2/3. Correct.

Then, P(TT) = 2/3.

Then P(HT) = 0.5 * 2/3 = 1/3.

Then P(T) = 0.5 * P(TH) + 0.5 * P(TT) = 0.5*(2/3) + 0.5*(2/3) = 2/3. Correct.

Then P(H) = 0.5*P(HH) + 0.5*P(HT) = 0.5*1 + 0.5*(1/3) = 0.5 + 1/6 = 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6. Correct.

Then P(S) = 0.5*P(H) + 0.5*P(T) = 0.5*(5/6) + 0.5*(2/3) = 5/12 + 2/6 = 5/12 + 4/12 = 9/12 = 3/4. So 0.75.

But according to my knowledge from Penney's game, the probability that HHT comes before HTH is 2/3. Wait, but I need to verify this.

Wait, according to the Penney's game probabilities, for the pair HHT vs HTH, the probability of HHT occurring before HTH is 2/3. For example, the probability that HHT appears before HTH in a fair coin flip is 2/3. However, my calculation here says 3/4, which conflicts. So where is the mistake?

Let me check the setup of the equations again. Perhaps I missed some state transitions.

Let me consider a simple case. For example, starting from state S, let's simulate.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the definition of the states. For example, when we're in state HT, and we flip a T, we go to state TT. But what about the possibility of overlapping patterns?

Alternatively, let's use another method. Let me recall that for competing patterns, the probability can be found using the formula involving the odds of the patterns.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, use recursion with the equations again, but double-checking the transitions.

Let me think about a specific example: starting from S, what is the probability?

Suppose the first flip is H (prob 0.5), then we're in state H. From H, next flip is H or T. If it's H, go to HH. If T, go to HT.

From HH, as we said, P(HH) = 1.

From HT, there's a 0.5 chance to get A's win (H) or go to TT.

From TT, you have to go through TH or stay in TT.

Wait, but maybe there's an error in the equation for P(TH). Let me check the equation for P(TH). When in TH, flipping H leads to HH, and flipping T leads to HT. Thus:

P(TH) = 0.5 * P(HH) + 0.5 * P(HT) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (0.5 * P(TT)) → wait no, earlier we had P(HT) = 0.5 * P(TT). So substituting:

P(TH) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (0.5 * P(TT)) = 0.5 + 0.25 * P(TT). But earlier, we had from equation 7 that P(TT) = P(TH). So substituting:

P(TH) = 0.5 + 0.25 * P(TH)

Which gives:

P(TH) - 0.25 P(TH) = 0.5 → 0.75 P(TH) = 0.5 → P(TH) = 2/3, which matches earlier result. So that seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought P(TH) was 0.5 + 0.5 * P(HT), but P(HT) is 0.5 * P(TT), and since P(TT) = P(TH), that gives 0.5 + 0.5*(0.5*P(TH)) = 0.5 + 0.25 P(TH). So that's correct.

Thus, the calculation seems correct. Then why does it differ from my recollection of Penney's game? Let me check a reference.

Upon checking, in Penney's game, the probability that HHT occurs before HTH is indeed 2/3. So why does this calculation give 3/4? There must be a mistake in the state definitions or transitions.

Let me try another approach. Let me simulate the probabilities using the equations again, but perhaps I made an error in the equations.

Wait, another way: Let me consider that from state S, the probability that B wins is P(S) = 3/4. If that's true, then the probability that B wins is 3/4, and A wins with probability 1/4. But according to Penney's game, it should be 2/3 for B and 1/3 for A. So there's inconsistency.

Let me check another source. According to the Penney's game, the probability of HHT occurring before HTH is 2/3. Here's a way to calculate it using states:

The states are defined differently. Let me consider the following states:

- Start (S)

- H

- HH

- HT

- TH

- T

Now, using absorbing states for HTH and HHT.

Let me define the probabilities again, but maybe with different state transitions.

Alternatively, I can refer to the Markov chain approach. Let me try to model this correctly.

Another resource says that for two patterns A and B, the probability that B occurs before A can be found using the formula:

P(B wins) = (P_A / (P_A + P_B))

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it involves comparing the expected number of trials.

Alternatively, let's refer to the odds of the two patterns. The probability that HHT appears before HTH can be calculated by considering the possible overlaps.

For example, HTH has a self-overlap: if the first two flips are HT, and then a T occurs, it doesn't help towards HTH, but if a H occurs, it completes the pattern. HHT has a self-overlap of HH.

But perhaps the calculation using states is correct, and my previous belief about Penney's game was incorrect. Let me try to find the exact probability for HHT vs HTH.

Another way to calculate this is using the following method from probability theory: the probability that HHT occurs before HTH is equal to the probability that the first occurrence of either pattern is HHT.

Let me think about the problem in terms of the states and the transitions again.

Let me try to calculate P(S) using the equations I had before, which gave 3/4. Let's do a simulation or use another method.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the expected number of steps, but that might not help.

Alternatively, think of the game as follows:

After the first flip, which is H with 0.5, T with 0.5.

If it's T, then we have to wait. If it's H, then we go to state H.

Let me think recursively.

Let me define P as the probability that B wins starting from S.

From S, P = 0.5 * P_H + 0.5 * P_T

Where P_H is the probability from state H, and P_T from state T.

Now, from state H:

P_H = 0.5 * P_HH + 0.5 * P_HT

From state HH:

P_HH = 0.5 * P_HH + 0.5 * 1 → P_HH = 1

From state HT:

P_HT = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * P_TT

From state T:

P_T = 0.5 * P_TH + 0.5 * P_TT

From state TH:

P_TH = 0.5 * P_HH + 0.5 * P_HT = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 *
