Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about figuring out the minimum number of airplanes needed to get one airplane all the way around the world, with the condition that all planes must return safely. Each plane can only fly half the distance around the world on a full tank. They can refuel in flight without any loss, and the island is the only source of fuel.

First, I need to visualize the problem. The world is a great circle, so going around it is 1 full trip. Each plane can fly 1/2 of that distance on its own. So, to go all the way around, a plane would need to have enough fuel for the entire trip, which is double its capacity. Therefore, without any help, it's impossible. But with other planes helping by transferring fuel mid-air, maybe we can do it.

This reminds me of the classic airplane fuel transfer problem. I think the solution involves multiple planes assisting the main one by transferring fuel at certain points and then returning to the base. The key is to figure out how many planes are needed to provide enough fuel for the main plane to complete the trip, while ensuring that all assisting planes can return safely.

Let me break it down. Let's assume that the distance around the world is 1 unit. Each plane can carry enough fuel to fly 1/2 units. So, the fuel capacity is 1/2 units. When planes meet, they can transfer fuel. The challenge is to coordinate these transfers so that the main plane gets enough fuel to go all the way around, and all other planes have enough fuel to return.

Let me think about how fuel transfers work. If two planes meet, they can share fuel. For example, if two planes start together, they can fly some distance, then transfer fuel. Suppose they fly x distance. Each plane would have used x fuel. If they transfer fuel, the total fuel available is 2*(1/2 - x) = 1 - 2x. But how is this distributed?

Wait, maybe I should consider that each plane can carry fuel for 1/2 the trip. So, if a plane is going to fly a certain distance, it needs fuel proportional to that distance. So, for example, if a plane is going to fly distance d, it needs d amount of fuel. But since each plane can carry 1/2, they can only fly up to 1/2 distance on their own.

So, the idea is that multiple planes can accompany the main plane for part of the journey, transferring fuel to it, and then returning. The number of planes needed depends on how much fuel they can transfer before they have to return.

Let me think of a simple case. Suppose we have one plane. It can't go around the world because it can only fly 1/2. So, we need more planes.

If we have two planes. Let's say both start together. They fly together for some distance, then one transfers fuel to the other. But both need to return. Let me try to calculate.

Suppose two planes start together. They fly together for x distance. Each has used x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left. If one plane transfers fuel to the other, how much can it transfer? Let's say plane A transfers fuel to plane B. Plane A needs to have enough fuel to return. So, after transferring, plane A must have enough fuel to go back x distance. So, the amount of fuel plane A can transfer is (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. That's the amount that can be transferred to plane B. Then, plane B would have its original 1/2 - x plus the transferred fuel, which is 1/2 - x + (1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 3x. But plane B needs to go the rest of the way. Wait, but after the transfer, plane B would have 1 - 3x fuel. However, the total distance is 1, so after flying x, the remaining distance is 1 - x. So, plane B needs 1 - x fuel. So, 1 - 3x must be ≥ 1 - x → 1 - 3x ≥ 1 - x → -3x ≥ -x → -2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 0. Which is impossible. So, this approach doesn't work. Maybe two planes aren't enough.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. If two planes fly together for x distance, each uses x fuel. So each has 1/2 - x fuel left. If one plane (say, plane A) transfers fuel to plane B, then plane A needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is x, so plane A needs x fuel. Therefore, the fuel that can be transferred is (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. So, plane B receives 1/2 - 2x fuel. Then, plane B's total fuel is (original fuel after flying x) + transferred fuel = (1/2 - x) + (1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 3x. But plane B needs to go the remaining distance of 1 - x. So, 1 - 3x must be ≥ 1 - x. Which simplifies to 1 - 3x ≥ 1 - x → -3x ≥ -x → -2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 0. Which is impossible. So, even with two planes, this approach doesn't work. Therefore, two planes can't help the main plane go all the way around.

So, moving on to three planes. Let's think about three planes. Maybe they can help in a more complex way. Let me consider that multiple planes can accompany the main plane for different segments of the journey, transferring fuel at various points.

I remember that this problem is similar to the classic problem where the minimum number of planes required is 3. Wait, but I need to verify.

Alternatively, maybe it's more than three. Let me think step by step.

Let me consider that the main plane needs to have enough fuel for the entire trip. Since each plane can carry 1/2 fuel, the main plane would need 1 fuel. So, the idea is that other planes can transfer fuel to it. Each transfer from another plane can contribute some fuel, but the other planes must have enough to return.

Let me think of the problem in terms of fuel depots. For example, if multiple planes fly out together, transfer fuel, and then return. The fuel that is transferred can be stored for the main plane.

But since the planes can refuel mid-air, maybe the optimal way is to have multiple planes accompany the main plane for a certain distance, transfer fuel, and then return. The number of planes needed depends on how much fuel they can transfer before they have to return.

Let me try with three planes. Let's say all three planes start together. They fly for a distance x. Each has used x fuel, so each has 1/2 - x fuel left. Now, two of the planes (say, planes B and C) will transfer fuel to the main plane (plane A), and then return. Let's see how much fuel can be transferred.

Each of planes B and C needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is x, so each needs x fuel. So, the amount of fuel they can transfer is (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. So, each can transfer 1/2 - 2x fuel to plane A. Since there are two planes, total transferred is 2*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 4x.

Plane A, after flying x distance, has 1/2 - x fuel. Then, after receiving 1 - 4x fuel, its total fuel is (1/2 - x) + (1 - 4x) = 1/2 + 1 - 5x = 3/2 - 5x.

Now, plane A needs to have enough fuel to complete the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 1 - x. So, the fuel required is 1 - x. Therefore:

3/2 - 5x ≥ 1 - x

Solving:

3/2 - 5x ≥ 1 - x

Subtract 1 from both sides:

1/2 - 5x ≥ -x

Add 5x to both sides:

1/2 ≥ 4x

So, x ≤ 1/8.

So, if x is 1/8, then the fuel in plane A would be 3/2 - 5*(1/8) = 3/2 - 5/8 = 12/8 - 5/8 = 7/8. The remaining distance is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. So, exactly enough. So, with three planes, if they fly 1/8 of the distance, transfer fuel, and return, then the main plane can proceed with the remaining 7/8 distance. Wait, but the main plane would have 7/8 fuel, which is exactly enough for the remaining 7/8 distance. So, that works.

But wait, in this case, the main plane would have just enough fuel to go the remaining distance. However, the problem states that all planes must return safely. In this scenario, the two assisting planes (B and C) would have transferred their fuel and returned. So, that seems okay.

But wait, let me check the fuel calculations again. When the three planes start, they each have 1/2 fuel. They fly x = 1/8. Each uses 1/8 fuel, so remaining fuel is 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8. Planes B and C transfer fuel to plane A. Each can transfer up to (3/8 - 1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4. So, each transfers 1/4, total of 1/2. Plane A's fuel after receiving is 3/8 + 1/2 = 3/8 + 4/8 = 7/8. Which is exactly the fuel needed for the remaining 7/8 distance. So, that works. Then, plane A can complete the trip. But wait, plane A would need to go the remaining 7/8 distance. But with 7/8 fuel, that's exactly enough. So, plane A can make it. But then, what about the other planes? Planes B and C, after transferring 1/4 each, they have 3/8 - 1/4 = 3/8 - 2/8 = 1/8 fuel left. They need to return, which is 1/8 distance. So, they have exactly enough fuel. So, yes, they can return. So, this seems to work with three planes.

Wait, but this seems too easy. However, I thought the answer might be more than three. Let me check again. Because the problem says that the main plane has to go all the way around the world. But in this scenario, the main plane starts with three planes, goes 1/8, gets fuel, and then proceeds. But after that, the main plane is alone. But can it make it? Yes, because it has exactly the fuel needed for the remaining 7/8. So, that seems to work. But then why is this problem considered challenging? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Because the problem says that the fuel capacity is exactly 1/2 way around the world. So, each plane can carry fuel for 1/2 the trip. So, if the main plane receives 1/2 fuel from the two other planes, but after flying 1/8, it has 3/8 fuel, then receives 1/2 fuel, totaling 7/8. But 7/8 is more than the 1/2 capacity. Wait, that's impossible. Because the plane can only carry fuel up to its capacity. Wait, this is a critical point. If the plane can only carry fuel up to 1/2, then transferring more than that would not be possible. So, my previous calculation is wrong because I assumed that the plane can receive more than its capacity.

Ah, here's the mistake. The planes can't carry more than their fuel capacity. So, when transferring fuel, the amount that can be transferred is limited by the capacity of the receiving plane. So, in this case, plane A can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. So, when it receives fuel from the other planes, it can't exceed that.

Wait, but initially, plane A had 3/8 fuel after flying 1/8. Then, the two other planes transfer fuel to it. But the total fuel that can be transferred is limited by the capacity of plane A. Let me recalculate.

Plane A's capacity is 1/2. After flying 1/8, it has 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel. So, the maximum amount of fuel it can receive is 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8. So, even if planes B and C want to transfer fuel to plane A, they can only transfer up to 1/8 in total. Because plane A can't hold more than 1/2. Therefore, my previous calculation was incorrect because I didn't account for the capacity limit of the receiving plane.

So, this changes things. Let's redo the calculation with this in mind.

Three planes start together. They fly x distance. Each uses x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left. Now, planes B and C want to transfer fuel to plane A. However, plane A can only take up to 1/2 fuel. Since plane A already has 1/2 - x fuel, it can receive up to (1/2 - (1/2 - x)) = x fuel. So, the total fuel that can be transferred to plane A is x.

But planes B and C can only transfer fuel up to their remaining capacity, which is 1/2 - x each. So, the total amount they can transfer is 2*(1/2 - x) - but they can't transfer more than x to plane A.

So, the maximum amount that can be transferred is the minimum of x and 2*(1/2 - x). Let's set x = 2*(1/2 - x). Solving for x:

x = 1 - 2x → 3x = 1 → x = 1/3.

Wait, but if x is 1/3, then the amount that can be transferred is x = 1/3. However, planes B and C each have 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6 fuel left. So, total available is 2*(1/6) = 1/3. Which matches x. So, in this case, planes B and C can transfer all their remaining fuel (1/3 total) to plane A. Then, plane A would have its original 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6 plus 1/3, totaling 1/2. So, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which is enough to fly 1/2 distance. But the remaining distance after x=1/3 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. So, plane A only has 1/2 fuel, which is not enough for 2/3. Therefore, this doesn't work.

Hmm, so this approach isn't sufficient. So, maybe with three planes, it's not possible. Then, what's the correct approach?

Alternatively, maybe the planes need to make multiple trips or meet at different points. Maybe more planes are needed.

Let me think about the classic solution for this problem. I recall that the minimum number of planes required is 3 for certain distances, but perhaps for a full circle, it's more. Wait, I think the answer is 3, but I might be wrong.

Alternatively, let's consider that the problem requires multiple stages of fuel transfer. For example, planes might accompany the main plane for a certain distance, then return, while others accompany for further distances.

Let me try with three planes again, but with a different approach. Suppose that two planes accompany the main plane for a certain distance, then return, and another plane accompanies for a different distance.

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires more planes. Let me look up the classic problem. Wait, I can't look things up, but I need to think through.

Another approach: The total amount of fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world is 1 unit (since it needs to fly 1 unit distance). Each plane can carry 1/2 units. So, the main plane needs 1 unit of fuel. However, the fuel can be supplied by other planes. But each time a plane helps, it uses fuel to carry the extra fuel.

Let me think about fuel consumption. For any plane that helps, the fuel it uses is for its own trip plus the fuel it transfers. For example, if a plane flies with the main plane for a distance x, then transfers fuel, and returns, it uses fuel for 2x (there and back), plus any fuel it transferred. Wait, but the fuel it transfers is part of the fuel it carried.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use the concept of fuel depots. For example, if you have multiple planes that can create fuel depots at certain points, allowing the main plane to refuel.

Alternatively, think recursively. To get the main plane to go a certain distance, you need other planes to help. Let's consider that to get the main plane to go distance d, you need a certain number of planes.

But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Suppose that we need to have fuel at various points along the journey. For example, to get the main plane to go 1/2 distance, it needs 1/2 fuel. But to get fuel to that point, other planes can carry fuel there and then return.

But since the planes can only carry 1/2 fuel, they can only go 1/2 distance. So, if a plane wants to go to a point x and return, it needs to have enough fuel for 2x. Therefore, x must be ≤ 1/4. Because 2x ≤ 1/2 → x ≤ 1/4.

So, if you want to establish a fuel depot at x = 1/4, a plane can carry fuel there and return. The fuel it can carry to the depot is (1/2 - 2x). For x=1/4, that's 1/2 - 2*(1/4) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0. So, no fuel can be carried. That's not helpful.

Wait, that suggests that you can't establish a fuel depot beyond 1/4 distance. Hmm. So, maybe multiple planes are needed to carry fuel to that point.

Alternatively, maybe multiple planes can accompany each other to a certain point, transfer fuel, and then return. For example, two planes can go to 1/8 distance, transfer fuel, and return. Let's see.

If two planes fly to 1/8 distance. Each uses 1/8 fuel. They have 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel left. They can transfer fuel to the main plane. But the main plane is at 1/8. Let's say the main plane is going to go further. However, the two planes need to return, so they can transfer up to (3/8 - 1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel each. So, total transferred is 2*(1/4) = 1/2. The main plane, which was at 1/8 with 3/8 fuel, now has 3/8 + 1/2 = 3/8 + 4/8 = 7/8 fuel. But again, the problem is that the main plane can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. Wait, so this is the same issue as before. The main plane can't hold more than 1/2 fuel. So, the maximum it can receive is 1/2 - (initial fuel). If the main plane was at 1/8 with 3/8 fuel, it can receive up to 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8 fuel. So, the two planes can only transfer 1/8 fuel to the main plane, not 1/2. So, the previous calculation was wrong because it didn't account for the capacity.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to look for the standard solution to this problem.

Wait, I remember that the minimum number of planes required is 3. Let me try to think again with three planes, but this time considering that the main plane can only carry up to 1/2 fuel.

Let me try with three planes: A, B, and C. All start together. They fly for x distance. Each uses x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left.

At this point, planes B and C will transfer fuel to plane A, and then return. But plane A can only take up to 1/2 fuel. Plane A currently has 1/2 - x fuel. So, it can receive up to x fuel (since 1/2 - x + x = 1/2).

Planes B and C can transfer fuel to plane A up to x total. However, each of them has 1/2 - x fuel. So, the total fuel available from B and C is 2*(1/2 - x). So, the amount that can be transferred is min(x, 2*(1/2 - x)).

To maximize the fuel transferred, we set x = 2*(1/2 - x). Solving:

x = 1 - 2x → 3x = 1 → x = 1/3.

But if x = 1/3, then the available fuel from B and C is 2*(1/2 - 1/3) = 2*(1/6) = 1/3. And x is 1/3, so the amount that can be transferred is 1/3. Plane A can receive 1/3, which would make its fuel 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/3 = 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/3 = 1/2. So, plane A now has 1/2 fuel. But the remaining distance is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Plane A needs 2/3 fuel, but only has 1/2. Not enough. So, this doesn't work.

So, even with three planes, this approach doesn't help. What if we use more planes? Let's try with four planes.

Four planes: A, B, C, D. All start together. They fly x distance. Each uses x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left.

Now, planes B, C, D will transfer fuel to A and return. Plane A can receive up to 1/2 - (1/2 - x) = x fuel. So, the total fuel that can be transferred is x. The available fuel from B, C, D is 3*(1/2 - x). So, set 3*(1/2 - x) = x → 3/2 - 3x = x → 3/2 = 4x → x = 3/8.

So, x = 3/8. Then, the available fuel from B, C, D is 3*(1/2 - 3/8) = 3*(1/8) = 3/8. Which is equal to x = 3/8. So, plane A receives 3/8 fuel. Its initial fuel after flying x is 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8. Adding 3/8 gives 1/8 + 3/8 = 1/2. So, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which allows it to fly 1/2 distance. The remaining distance after x=3/8 is 1 - 3/8 = 5/8. Plane A needs 5/8 fuel, but only has 1/2. Not enough. Still not sufficient.

Hmm. So, with four planes, it's still not enough. Let's try with five planes.

Five planes: A, B, C, D, E. All start together. Fly x distance. Each uses x fuel, so has 1/2 - x left.

Planes B, C, D, E transfer fuel to A and return. Plane A can receive up to x fuel. Total fuel available from B, C, D, E is 4*(1/2 - x). Set 4*(1/2 - x) = x → 2 - 4x = x → 2 = 5x → x = 2/5 = 0.4.

So, x = 2/5. Available fuel from B, C, D, E is 4*(1/2 - 2/5) = 4*(5/10 - 4/10) = 4*(1/10) = 4/10 = 2/5. Which equals x. So, plane A receives 2/5 fuel. Its initial fuel after flying x is 1/2 - 2/5 = 5/10 - 4/10 = 1/10. Adding 2/5 (which is 4/10) gives 5/10 = 1/2. Again, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which is enough for 1/2 distance. The remaining distance is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5. Plane A needs 3/5 fuel, but only has 1/2. Still not enough.

This pattern suggests that with n planes, the maximum fuel the main plane can get is 1/2, which is not enough for the remaining distance. Therefore, this approach isn't working. So, what's the correct way?

Maybe the solution involves multiple stages. For example, the main plane is accompanied by other planes for part of the journey, then those planes return, and other planes accompany it for another part. Let's try this.

Let me think of the journey divided into segments. Suppose we have two stages. First, planes accompany the main plane for a certain distance, then return. Then, other planes accompany it for another distance.

For example, let's say we have three planes: A, B, and C. They all start together. They fly to a point x, where they transfer fuel, and then B and C return. Then, A continues with the fuel it received, and then another plane accompanies it for the next segment.

Wait, but this would require more planes. Let me try.

First, three planes: A, B, C. They fly to x, transfer fuel, B and C return. Then, A continues. But as before, A gets 1/2 fuel, which isn't enough. So, maybe after that, another plane accompanies A for the next segment.

But this would require more planes. Let's say after the first segment, another plane D accompanies A for a distance y, then D returns. Let's calculate.

First segment: A, B, C fly to x. Fuel transferred to A is x (as before). A has 1/2 fuel. Then, A flies to y, with D accompanying.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to model it mathematically.

Let me consider that the total fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world is 1. To achieve this, we need to have fuel supplied at various points.

Let me think about the fuel required for each segment. Suppose the main plane needs to go from point 0 to 1. Let's divide the journey into two segments: from 0 to x, and from x to 1.

To get to x, the main plane needs fuel for x. To get from x to 1, it needs fuel for 1 - x. But the fuel for the second segment must be supplied by other planes.

Let's say that to supply fuel for the second segment, we need other planes to carry fuel to x and transfer it to the main plane.

Each plane that carries fuel to x and returns must have enough fuel for 2x (to go to x and back). So, the fuel they can carry to x is (1/2 - 2x). Let's say we have n planes that do this. The total fuel they can carry to x is n*(1/2 - 2x). This fuel is then transferred to the main plane, which needs 1 - x fuel for the second segment.

So, the equation is:

n*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - x.

But also, the main plane must have enough fuel to reach x. Initially, it has 1/2 fuel. If it uses x fuel to reach x, then it has 1/2 - x fuel. But it needs to have enough fuel to go from x to 1, which requires 1 - x fuel. So, unless the other planes supply that fuel, the main plane can't make it. So, the fuel from the other planes is 1 - x, which must be equal to n*(1/2 - 2x).

But also, the main plane must have enough fuel to reach x, which is 1/2 - x. If this is positive, then it's okay. So, 1/2 - x > 0 → x < 1/2.

So, solving the equation n*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - x.

But we also need to ensure that the planes supplying the fuel can actually carry it. So, 1/2 - 2x > 0 → x < 1/4.

So, x must be less than 1/4.

Let's pick x = 1/4 - ε, but for simplicity, let's try x = 1/4. Then, 1/2 - 2x = 1/2 - 2*(1/4) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0. So, no fuel can be supplied. Not helpful.

Let's try x = 1/6. Then, 1/2 - 2*(1/6) = 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6. So, each plane can supply 1/6 fuel to x. The total fuel needed is 1 - x = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. So, n*(1/6) = 5/6 → n = 5. So, five planes are needed to supply the fuel for the second segment. But then, the main plane needs to reach x = 1/6 with its own fuel. It starts with 1/2 fuel, uses 1/6 to get to x, so has 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3 fuel. Then, it receives 5/6 fuel from the five planes. But the main plane can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. So, 1/3 + 5/6 = 7/6, which is more than 1/2. So, it can't carry all of it. Hence, this approach is invalid.

This suggests that the fuel supply from other planes must be limited by the main plane's capacity. So, the amount that can be transferred is min(1 - x, 1/2 - (1/2 - x)) = min(1 - x, x). Wait, the main plane has 1/2 - x fuel at x, and can receive up to x fuel (since 1/2 - x + x = 1/2). So, the maximum fuel that can be transferred is x. So, the equation becomes x = n*(1/2 - 2x). So, n = x / (1/2 - 2x).

But we also have that the fuel needed is 1 - x, which must be ≤ x (since the main plane can only receive x fuel). So, 1 - x ≤ x → 1 ≤ 2x → x ≥ 1/2. But this contradicts the earlier requirement that x < 1/4. So, this is impossible. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

This seems to indicate that it's impossible to get the main plane to complete the journey with this method. But the problem states that it's possible, so I must be missing something.

Let me think about the classic solution. In the classic problem where you need to get a plane around the world with fuel depots, the minimum number of planes is 3. But I need to recall the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the planes can make multiple trips. For example, some planes can accompany the main plane for part of the journey, then return to the base, refuel, and come back again to provide more fuel.

Let me try this approach. Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C.

1. All three planes start together. They fly together for a distance x. Each uses x fuel, so they have 1/2 - x fuel left.

2. At this point, planes B and C transfer fuel to plane A, and then return to the base. The amount they can transfer is limited by their remaining fuel and the need to return. Each needs x fuel to return, so they can transfer (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x fuel each. So, total transferred is 2*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 4x. Plane A receives this fuel, so its total fuel is (1/2 - x) + (1 - 4x) = 3/2 - 5x.

But plane A can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. So, 3/2 - 5x ≤ 1/2 → 3/2 - 1/2 ≤ 5x → 1 ≤ 5x → x ≥ 1/5.

But also, the planes B and C must have enough fuel to return: 1/2 - 2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 1/4.

So, x is between 1/5 and 1/4.

Let's choose x = 1/5. Then, the fuel transferred is 1 - 4*(1/5) = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5. Plane A's fuel after receiving is 3/2 - 5*(1/5) = 3/2 - 1 = 1/2. So, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which allows it to fly 1/2 distance. The remaining distance is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Plane A needs 4/5 fuel, but only has 1/2. Not enough.

But if x = 1/4, then the fuel transferred is 1 - 4*(1/4) = 1 - 1 = 0. So, no fuel is transferred. Not helpful.

So, this approach still doesn't work.

Maybe I need to use more planes. Let's try with four planes.

Let's say four planes: A, B, C, D. They all start together. Fly to x. Each uses x fuel, so have 1/2 - x left.

Planes B, C, D transfer fuel to A and return. Each can transfer (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. Total transferred is 3*(1/'

--- Question 50/50 ---
Question: On an Island, there is an airport that has an unlimited number of identical air-planes. Each air-plane has a fuel capacity to allow it to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, along a great circle. The planes have the ability to refuel in flight without loss of speed or spillage of fuel. Though the fuel is unlimited, the island is the only source of fuel. You can ignore the time and fuel consumption of refuelling.
What is the minimum number of air-planes required to get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport?
  (Noise added: ' Interesting fact: cats sleep for most of their li...')
Model Raw Answer: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about figuring out the minimum number of airplanes needed to get one airplane all the way around the world, with the condition that all planes must return safely. Each plane can only fly half the distance around the world on a full tank. They can refuel in flight without any loss, and the island is the only source of fuel.

First, I need to visualize the problem. The world is a great circle, so going around it is 1 full trip. Each plane can fly 1/2 of that distance on its own. So, to go all the way around, a plane would need to have enough fuel for the entire trip, which is double its capacity. Therefore, without any help, it's impossible. But with other planes helping by transferring fuel mid-air, maybe we can do it.

This reminds me of the classic airplane fuel transfer problem. I think the solution involves multiple planes assisting the main one by transferring fuel at certain points and then returning to the base. The key is to figure out how many planes are needed to provide enough fuel for the main plane to complete the trip, while ensuring that all assisting planes can return safely.

Let me break it down. Let's assume that the distance around the world is 1 unit. Each plane can carry enough fuel to fly 1/2 units. So, the fuel capacity is 1/2 units. When planes meet, they can transfer fuel. The challenge is to coordinate these transfers so that the main plane gets enough fuel to go all the way around, and all other planes have enough fuel to return.

Let me think about how fuel transfers work. If two planes meet, they can share fuel. For example, if two planes start together, they can fly some distance, then transfer fuel. Suppose they fly x distance. Each plane would have used x fuel. If they transfer fuel, the total fuel available is 2*(1/2 - x) = 1 - 2x. But how is this distributed?

Wait, maybe I should consider that each plane can carry fuel for 1/2 the trip. So, if a plane is going to fly a certain distance, it needs fuel proportional to that distance. So, for example, if a plane is going to fly distance d, it needs d amount of fuel. But since each plane can carry 1/2, they can only fly up to 1/2 distance on their own.

So, the idea is that multiple planes can accompany the main plane for part of the journey, transferring fuel to it, and then returning. The number of planes needed depends on how much fuel they can transfer before they have to return.

Let me think of a simple case. Suppose we have one plane. It can't go around the world because it can only fly 1/2. So, we need more planes.

If we have two planes. Let's say both start together. They fly together for some distance, then one transfers fuel to the other. But both need to return. Let me try to calculate.

Suppose two planes start together. They fly together for x distance. Each has used x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left. If one plane transfers fuel to the other, how much can it transfer? Let's say plane A transfers fuel to plane B. Plane A needs to have enough fuel to return. So, after transferring, plane A must have enough fuel to go back x distance. So, the amount of fuel plane A can transfer is (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. That's the amount that can be transferred to plane B. Then, plane B would have its original 1/2 - x plus the transferred fuel, which is 1/2 - x + (1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 3x. But plane B needs to go the rest of the way. Wait, but after the transfer, plane B would have 1 - 3x fuel. However, the total distance is 1, so after flying x, the remaining distance is 1 - x. So, plane B needs 1 - x fuel. So, 1 - 3x must be ≥ 1 - x → 1 - 3x ≥ 1 - x → -3x ≥ -x → -2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 0. Which is impossible. So, this approach doesn't work. Maybe two planes aren't enough.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. If two planes fly together for x distance, each uses x fuel. So each has 1/2 - x fuel left. If one plane (say, plane A) transfers fuel to plane B, then plane A needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is x, so plane A needs x fuel. Therefore, the fuel that can be transferred is (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. So, plane B receives 1/2 - 2x fuel. Then, plane B's total fuel is (original fuel after flying x) + transferred fuel = (1/2 - x) + (1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 3x. But plane B needs to go the remaining distance of 1 - x. So, 1 - 3x must be ≥ 1 - x. Which simplifies to 1 - 3x ≥ 1 - x → -3x ≥ -x → -2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 0. Which is impossible. So, even with two planes, this approach doesn't work. Therefore, two planes can't help the main plane go all the way around.

So, moving on to three planes. Let's think about three planes. Maybe they can help in a more complex way. Let me consider that multiple planes can accompany the main plane for different segments of the journey, transferring fuel at various points.

I remember that this problem is similar to the classic problem where the minimum number of planes required is 3. Wait, but I need to verify.

Alternatively, maybe it's more than three. Let me think step by step.

Let me consider that the main plane needs to have enough fuel for the entire trip. Since each plane can carry 1/2 fuel, the main plane would need 1 fuel. So, the idea is that other planes can transfer fuel to it. Each transfer from another plane can contribute some fuel, but the other planes must have enough to return.

Let me think of the problem in terms of fuel depots. For example, if multiple planes fly out together, transfer fuel, and then return. The fuel that is transferred can be stored for the main plane.

But since the planes can refuel mid-air, maybe the optimal way is to have multiple planes accompany the main plane for a certain distance, transfer fuel, and then return. The number of planes needed depends on how much fuel they can transfer before they have to return.

Let me try with three planes. Let's say all three planes start together. They fly for a distance x. Each has used x fuel, so each has 1/2 - x fuel left. Now, two of the planes (say, planes B and C) will transfer fuel to the main plane (plane A), and then return. Let's see how much fuel can be transferred.

Each of planes B and C needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is x, so each needs x fuel. So, the amount of fuel they can transfer is (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. So, each can transfer 1/2 - 2x fuel to plane A. Since there are two planes, total transferred is 2*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 4x.

Plane A, after flying x distance, has 1/2 - x fuel. Then, after receiving 1 - 4x fuel, its total fuel is (1/2 - x) + (1 - 4x) = 1/2 + 1 - 5x = 3/2 - 5x.

Now, plane A needs to have enough fuel to complete the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 1 - x. So, the fuel required is 1 - x. Therefore:

3/2 - 5x ≥ 1 - x

Solving:

3/2 - 5x ≥ 1 - x

Subtract 1 from both sides:

1/2 - 5x ≥ -x

Add 5x to both sides:

1/2 ≥ 4x

So, x ≤ 1/8.

So, if x is 1/8, then the fuel in plane A would be 3/2 - 5*(1/8) = 3/2 - 5/8 = 12/8 - 5/8 = 7/8. The remaining distance is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. So, exactly enough. So, with three planes, if they fly 1/8 of the distance, transfer fuel, and return, then the main plane can proceed with the remaining 7/8 distance. Wait, but the main plane would have 7/8 fuel, which is exactly enough for the remaining 7/8 distance. So, that works.

But wait, in this case, the main plane would have just enough fuel to go the remaining distance. However, the problem states that all planes must return safely. In this scenario, the two assisting planes (B and C) would have transferred their fuel and returned. So, that seems okay.

But wait, let me check the fuel calculations again. When the three planes start, they each have 1/2 fuel. They fly x = 1/8. Each uses 1/8 fuel, so remaining fuel is 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8. Planes B and C transfer fuel to plane A. Each can transfer up to (3/8 - 1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4. So, each transfers 1/4, total of 1/2. Plane A's fuel after receiving is 3/8 + 1/2 = 3/8 + 4/8 = 7/8. Which is exactly the fuel needed for the remaining 7/8 distance. So, that works. Then, plane A can complete the trip. But wait, plane A would need to go the remaining 7/8 distance. But with 7/8 fuel, that's exactly enough. So, plane A can make it. But then, what about the other planes? Planes B and C, after transferring 1/4 each, they have 3/8 - 1/4 = 3/8 - 2/8 = 1/8 fuel left. They need to return, which is 1/8 distance. So, they have exactly enough fuel. So, yes, they can return. So, this seems to work with three planes.

Wait, but this seems too easy. However, I thought the answer might be more than three. Let me check again. Because the problem says that the main plane has to go all the way around the world. But in this scenario, the main plane starts with three planes, goes 1/8, gets fuel, and then proceeds. But after that, the main plane is alone. But can it make it? Yes, because it has exactly the fuel needed for the remaining 7/8. So, that seems to work. But then why is this problem considered challenging? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Because the problem says that the fuel capacity is exactly 1/2 way around the world. So, each plane can carry fuel for 1/2 the trip. So, if the main plane receives 1/2 fuel from the two other planes, but after flying 1/8, it has 3/8 fuel, then receives 1/2 fuel, totaling 7/8. But 7/8 is more than the 1/2 capacity. Wait, that's impossible. Because the plane can only carry fuel up to its capacity. Wait, this is a critical point. If the plane can only carry fuel up to 1/2, then transferring more than that would not be possible. So, my previous calculation is wrong because I assumed that the plane can receive more than its capacity.

Ah, here's the mistake. The planes can't carry more than their fuel capacity. So, when transferring fuel, the amount that can be transferred is limited by the capacity of the receiving plane. So, in this case, plane A can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. So, when it receives fuel from the other planes, it can't exceed that.

Wait, but initially, plane A had 3/8 fuel after flying 1/8. Then, the two other planes transfer fuel to it. But the total fuel that can be transferred is limited by the capacity of plane A. Let me recalculate.

Plane A's capacity is 1/2. After flying 1/8, it has 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel. So, the maximum amount of fuel it can receive is 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8. So, even if planes B and C want to transfer fuel to plane A, they can only transfer up to 1/8 in total. Because plane A can't hold more than 1/2. Therefore, my previous calculation was incorrect because I didn't account for the capacity limit of the receiving plane.

So, this changes things. Let's redo the calculation with this in mind.

Three planes start together. They fly x distance. Each uses x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left. Now, planes B and C want to transfer fuel to plane A. However, plane A can only take up to 1/2 fuel. Since plane A already has 1/2 - x fuel, it can receive up to (1/2 - (1/2 - x)) = x fuel. So, the total fuel that can be transferred to plane A is x.

But planes B and C can only transfer fuel up to their remaining capacity, which is 1/2 - x each. So, the total amount they can transfer is 2*(1/2 - x) - but they can't transfer more than x to plane A.

So, the maximum amount that can be transferred is the minimum of x and 2*(1/2 - x). Let's set x = 2*(1/2 - x). Solving for x:

x = 1 - 2x → 3x = 1 → x = 1/3.

Wait, but if x is 1/3, then the amount that can be transferred is x = 1/3. However, planes B and C each have 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6 fuel left. So, total available is 2*(1/6) = 1/3. Which matches x. So, in this case, planes B and C can transfer all their remaining fuel (1/3 total) to plane A. Then, plane A would have its original 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6 plus 1/3, totaling 1/2. So, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which is enough to fly 1/2 distance. But the remaining distance after x=1/3 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. So, plane A only has 1/2 fuel, which is not enough for 2/3. Therefore, this doesn't work.

Hmm, so this approach isn't sufficient. So, maybe with three planes, it's not possible. Then, what's the correct approach?

Alternatively, maybe the planes need to make multiple trips or meet at different points. Maybe more planes are needed.

Let me think about the classic solution for this problem. I recall that the minimum number of planes required is 3 for certain distances, but perhaps for a full circle, it's more. Wait, I think the answer is 3, but I might be wrong.

Alternatively, let's consider that the problem requires multiple stages of fuel transfer. For example, planes might accompany the main plane for a certain distance, then return, while others accompany for further distances.

Let me try with three planes again, but with a different approach. Suppose that two planes accompany the main plane for a certain distance, then return, and another plane accompanies for a different distance.

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires more planes. Let me look up the classic problem. Wait, I can't look things up, but I need to think through.

Another approach: The total amount of fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world is 1 unit (since it needs to fly 1 unit distance). Each plane can carry 1/2 units. So, the main plane needs 1 unit of fuel. However, the fuel can be supplied by other planes. But each time a plane helps, it uses fuel to carry the extra fuel.

Let me think about fuel consumption. For any plane that helps, the fuel it uses is for its own trip plus the fuel it transfers. For example, if a plane flies with the main plane for a distance x, then transfers fuel, and returns, it uses fuel for 2x (there and back), plus any fuel it transferred. Wait, but the fuel it transfers is part of the fuel it carried.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use the concept of fuel depots. For example, if you have multiple planes that can create fuel depots at certain points, allowing the main plane to refuel.

Alternatively, think recursively. To get the main plane to go a certain distance, you need other planes to help. Let's consider that to get the main plane to go distance d, you need a certain number of planes.

But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Suppose that we need to have fuel at various points along the journey. For example, to get the main plane to go 1/2 distance, it needs 1/2 fuel. But to get fuel to that point, other planes can carry fuel there and then return.

But since the planes can only carry 1/2 fuel, they can only go 1/2 distance. So, if a plane wants to go to a point x and return, it needs to have enough fuel for 2x. Therefore, x must be ≤ 1/4. Because 2x ≤ 1/2 → x ≤ 1/4.

So, if you want to establish a fuel depot at x = 1/4, a plane can carry fuel there and return. The fuel it can carry to the depot is (1/2 - 2x). For x=1/4, that's 1/2 - 2*(1/4) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0. So, no fuel can be carried. That's not helpful.

Wait, that suggests that you can't establish a fuel depot beyond 1/4 distance. Hmm. So, maybe multiple planes are needed to carry fuel to that point.

Alternatively, maybe multiple planes can accompany each other to a certain point, transfer fuel, and then return. For example, two planes can go to 1/8 distance, transfer fuel, and return. Let's see.

If two planes fly to 1/8 distance. Each uses 1/8 fuel. They have 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel left. They can transfer fuel to the main plane. But the main plane is at 1/8. Let's say the main plane is going to go further. However, the two planes need to return, so they can transfer up to (3/8 - 1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel each. So, total transferred is 2*(1/4) = 1/2. The main plane, which was at 1/8 with 3/8 fuel, now has 3/8 + 1/2 = 3/8 + 4/8 = 7/8 fuel. But again, the problem is that the main plane can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. Wait, so this is the same issue as before. The main plane can't hold more than 1/2 fuel. So, the maximum it can receive is 1/2 - (initial fuel). If the main plane was at 1/8 with 3/8 fuel, it can receive up to 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8 fuel. So, the two planes can only transfer 1/8 fuel to the main plane, not 1/2. So, the previous calculation was wrong because it didn't account for the capacity.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to look for the standard solution to this problem.

Wait, I remember that the minimum number of planes required is 3. Let me try to think again with three planes, but this time considering that the main plane can only carry up to 1/2 fuel.

Let me try with three planes: A, B, and C. All start together. They fly for x distance. Each uses x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left.

At this point, planes B and C will transfer fuel to plane A, and then return. But plane A can only take up to 1/2 fuel. Plane A currently has 1/2 - x fuel. So, it can receive up to x fuel (since 1/2 - x + x = 1/2).

Planes B and C can transfer fuel to plane A up to x total. However, each of them has 1/2 - x fuel. So, the total fuel available from B and C is 2*(1/2 - x). So, the amount that can be transferred is min(x, 2*(1/2 - x)).

To maximize the fuel transferred, we set x = 2*(1/2 - x). Solving:

x = 1 - 2x → 3x = 1 → x = 1/3.

But if x = 1/3, then the available fuel from B and C is 2*(1/2 - 1/3) = 2*(1/6) = 1/3. And x is 1/3, so the amount that can be transferred is 1/3. Plane A can receive 1/3, which would make its fuel 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/3 = 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/3 = 1/2. So, plane A now has 1/2 fuel. But the remaining distance is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Plane A needs 2/3 fuel, but only has 1/2. Not enough. So, this doesn't work.

So, even with three planes, this approach doesn't help. What if we use more planes? Let's try with four planes.

Four planes: A, B, C, D. All start together. They fly x distance. Each uses x fuel. So, each has 1/2 - x fuel left.

Now, planes B, C, D will transfer fuel to A and return. Plane A can receive up to 1/2 - (1/2 - x) = x fuel. So, the total fuel that can be transferred is x. The available fuel from B, C, D is 3*(1/2 - x). So, set 3*(1/2 - x) = x → 3/2 - 3x = x → 3/2 = 4x → x = 3/8.

So, x = 3/8. Then, the available fuel from B, C, D is 3*(1/2 - 3/8) = 3*(1/8) = 3/8. Which is equal to x = 3/8. So, plane A receives 3/8 fuel. Its initial fuel after flying x is 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8. Adding 3/8 gives 1/8 + 3/8 = 1/2. So, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which allows it to fly 1/2 distance. The remaining distance after x=3/8 is 1 - 3/8 = 5/8. Plane A needs 5/8 fuel, but only has 1/2. Not enough. Still not sufficient.

Hmm. So, with four planes, it's still not enough. Let's try with five planes.

Five planes: A, B, C, D, E. All start together. Fly x distance. Each uses x fuel, so has 1/2 - x left.

Planes B, C, D, E transfer fuel to A and return. Plane A can receive up to x fuel. Total fuel available from B, C, D, E is 4*(1/2 - x). Set 4*(1/2 - x) = x → 2 - 4x = x → 2 = 5x → x = 2/5 = 0.4.

So, x = 2/5. Available fuel from B, C, D, E is 4*(1/2 - 2/5) = 4*(5/10 - 4/10) = 4*(1/10) = 4/10 = 2/5. Which equals x. So, plane A receives 2/5 fuel. Its initial fuel after flying x is 1/2 - 2/5 = 5/10 - 4/10 = 1/10. Adding 2/5 (which is 4/10) gives 5/10 = 1/2. Again, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which is enough for 1/2 distance. The remaining distance is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5. Plane A needs 3/5 fuel, but only has 1/2. Still not enough.

This pattern suggests that with n planes, the maximum fuel the main plane can get is 1/2, which is not enough for the remaining distance. Therefore, this approach isn't working. So, what's the correct way?

Maybe the solution involves multiple stages. For example, the main plane is accompanied by other planes for part of the journey, then those planes return, and other planes accompany it for another part. Let's try this.

Let me think of the journey divided into segments. Suppose we have two stages. First, planes accompany the main plane for a certain distance, then return. Then, other planes accompany it for another distance.

For example, let's say we have three planes: A, B, and C. They all start together. They fly to a point x, where they transfer fuel, and then B and C return. Then, A continues with the fuel it received, and then another plane accompanies it for the next segment.

Wait, but this would require more planes. Let me try.

First, three planes: A, B, C. They fly to x, transfer fuel, B and C return. Then, A continues. But as before, A gets 1/2 fuel, which isn't enough. So, maybe after that, another plane accompanies A for the next segment.

But this would require more planes. Let's say after the first segment, another plane D accompanies A for a distance y, then D returns. Let's calculate.

First segment: A, B, C fly to x. Fuel transferred to A is x (as before). A has 1/2 fuel. Then, A flies to y, with D accompanying.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to model it mathematically.

Let me consider that the total fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world is 1. To achieve this, we need to have fuel supplied at various points.

Let me think about the fuel required for each segment. Suppose the main plane needs to go from point 0 to 1. Let's divide the journey into two segments: from 0 to x, and from x to 1.

To get to x, the main plane needs fuel for x. To get from x to 1, it needs fuel for 1 - x. But the fuel for the second segment must be supplied by other planes.

Let's say that to supply fuel for the second segment, we need other planes to carry fuel to x and transfer it to the main plane.

Each plane that carries fuel to x and returns must have enough fuel for 2x (to go to x and back). So, the fuel they can carry to x is (1/2 - 2x). Let's say we have n planes that do this. The total fuel they can carry to x is n*(1/2 - 2x). This fuel is then transferred to the main plane, which needs 1 - x fuel for the second segment.

So, the equation is:

n*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - x.

But also, the main plane must have enough fuel to reach x. Initially, it has 1/2 fuel. If it uses x fuel to reach x, then it has 1/2 - x fuel. But it needs to have enough fuel to go from x to 1, which requires 1 - x fuel. So, unless the other planes supply that fuel, the main plane can't make it. So, the fuel from the other planes is 1 - x, which must be equal to n*(1/2 - 2x).

But also, the main plane must have enough fuel to reach x, which is 1/2 - x. If this is positive, then it's okay. So, 1/2 - x > 0 → x < 1/2.

So, solving the equation n*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - x.

But we also need to ensure that the planes supplying the fuel can actually carry it. So, 1/2 - 2x > 0 → x < 1/4.

So, x must be less than 1/4.

Let's pick x = 1/4 - ε, but for simplicity, let's try x = 1/4. Then, 1/2 - 2x = 1/2 - 2*(1/4) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0. So, no fuel can be supplied. Not helpful.

Let's try x = 1/6. Then, 1/2 - 2*(1/6) = 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6. So, each plane can supply 1/6 fuel to x. The total fuel needed is 1 - x = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. So, n*(1/6) = 5/6 → n = 5. So, five planes are needed to supply the fuel for the second segment. But then, the main plane needs to reach x = 1/6 with its own fuel. It starts with 1/2 fuel, uses 1/6 to get to x, so has 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3 fuel. Then, it receives 5/6 fuel from the five planes. But the main plane can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. So, 1/3 + 5/6 = 7/6, which is more than 1/2. So, it can't carry all of it. Hence, this approach is invalid.

This suggests that the fuel supply from other planes must be limited by the main plane's capacity. So, the amount that can be transferred is min(1 - x, 1/2 - (1/2 - x)) = min(1 - x, x). Wait, the main plane has 1/2 - x fuel at x, and can receive up to x fuel (since 1/2 - x + x = 1/2). So, the maximum fuel that can be transferred is x. So, the equation becomes x = n*(1/2 - 2x). So, n = x / (1/2 - 2x).

But we also have that the fuel needed is 1 - x, which must be ≤ x (since the main plane can only receive x fuel). So, 1 - x ≤ x → 1 ≤ 2x → x ≥ 1/2. But this contradicts the earlier requirement that x < 1/4. So, this is impossible. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

This seems to indicate that it's impossible to get the main plane to complete the journey with this method. But the problem states that it's possible, so I must be missing something.

Let me think about the classic solution. In the classic problem where you need to get a plane around the world with fuel depots, the minimum number of planes is 3. But I need to recall the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the planes can make multiple trips. For example, some planes can accompany the main plane for part of the journey, then return to the base, refuel, and come back again to provide more fuel.

Let me try this approach. Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C.

1. All three planes start together. They fly together for a distance x. Each uses x fuel, so they have 1/2 - x fuel left.

2. At this point, planes B and C transfer fuel to plane A, and then return to the base. The amount they can transfer is limited by their remaining fuel and the need to return. Each needs x fuel to return, so they can transfer (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x fuel each. So, total transferred is 2*(1/2 - 2x) = 1 - 4x. Plane A receives this fuel, so its total fuel is (1/2 - x) + (1 - 4x) = 3/2 - 5x.

But plane A can only carry up to 1/2 fuel. So, 3/2 - 5x ≤ 1/2 → 3/2 - 1/2 ≤ 5x → 1 ≤ 5x → x ≥ 1/5.

But also, the planes B and C must have enough fuel to return: 1/2 - 2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 1/4.

So, x is between 1/5 and 1/4.

Let's choose x = 1/5. Then, the fuel transferred is 1 - 4*(1/5) = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5. Plane A's fuel after receiving is 3/2 - 5*(1/5) = 3/2 - 1 = 1/2. So, plane A has 1/2 fuel, which allows it to fly 1/2 distance. The remaining distance is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Plane A needs 4/5 fuel, but only has 1/2. Not enough.

But if x = 1/4, then the fuel transferred is 1 - 4*(1/4) = 1 - 1 = 0. So, no fuel is transferred. Not helpful.

So, this approach still doesn't work.

Maybe I need to use more planes. Let's try with four planes.

Let's say four planes: A, B, C, D. They all start together. Fly to x. Each uses x fuel, so have 1/2 - x left.

Planes B, C, D transfer fuel to A and return. Each can transfer (1/2 - x) - x = 1/2 - 2x. Total transferred is 3*(1/
