Error decoding JSON from single agent: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)
Raw response (cleaned): '{n=1}^∞ P(trial ends on nth roll with success) * n

But this might be complex. Alternatively, use conditional expectation.

Let me define E as the expected number of rolls in a successful trial. Then, when we start a trial:

- With probability 1/3, we roll a 1 (success), and the number of rolls is 1.
- With probability 1/3, we roll a 2 (failure), and the trial doesn't contribute to E.
- With probability 1/3, we roll a 3, and then we have to continue, and the expected number of rolls becomes 1 + E (since we've already used 1 roll and now expect E more rolls in the successful trial).

But since we are conditioning on the trial being successful, the probability of success is 1/3, and the probability of continuing is 1/3. So the equation should be:

E = [ (1/3) * 1 + (1/3) * (1 + E) ] / P(trial is successful)

Wait, no. The correct way is to use the law of total expectation. Let me think again.

Let me denote that in a trial, the probability that it is successful is p = 1/3, and the probability it is not successful is q = 1/3, and the probability it continues is r = 1/3.

The expected number of rolls in a successful trial is E. Then, the expected number of rolls in any trial (successful or not) is T = 1 + r*T, which gives T = 3/2 as before.

But E is the expected number of rolls in a successful trial. To compute this, we can use the fact that the probability of success is p = 1/3, and the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is E = [expected number of rolls in a trial given that it is successful].

This can be calculated as E = [expected number of rolls in a trial * probability of success] / probability of success? No, that doesn't make sense.

Actually, the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is the expected number of rolls in all trials, weighted by the probability that the trial is successful.

Alternatively, consider that the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is E, and the expected number of rolls in a trial that is not successful is F. Then, the overall expected number'

Question: We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one. What is the expected number of final counts?
  (Noise added: ' Interesting fact: cats sleep for most of their li...')
Model Raw Answer: <think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this dice problem. So, the question is about the expected number of final counts when rolling a die under certain conditions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: We roll a die repeatedly, counting the number of rolls. However, if we roll an even number (which are 2, 4, 6 on a standard die), we reset the count back to zero. We stop rolling when we get a 1. The question is asking for the expected number of final counts. Hmm, I think that means the expected value of the count when we stop, which would be when we roll a 1.

Wait, but the count resets to zero whenever we get an even number. So, the count only increases when we roll an odd number that's not 1. Wait, no. Let me clarify the process.

Each time we roll the die, we increment the count by 1. But if the result is even, we reset the count to zero. If the result is 1, we stop. Otherwise, if it's an odd number (3 or 5), we just continue, keeping the count. Wait, but the problem says "count the number of times we roll." So maybe the count is the number of rolls made so far, but reset to zero when an even is rolled. But we stop when we get a 1. So, the final count is the number of rolls up to and including the roll that resulted in 1, but with resets when even numbers are rolled.

Wait, maybe I need to model this as a Markov process or use expected value equations. Let me think.

Let me denote E as the expected number of final counts. Let's consider the possible states. The process starts with a count of 0. Each time we roll the die:

- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1, and the process stops. The count is whatever it was before this roll. Wait, but if we are rolling the die, each roll increments the count? Or is the count the number of rolls made so far?

Wait, the problem says "count the number of times we roll." So each roll increases the count by 1. However, if we get an even number, we reset the count to zero. So, the count is the number of consecutive rolls without getting an even number, except that when you get an even, you reset. But when you get a 1, you stop. So the count is the number of rolls since the last reset (including the current roll) until a 1 is rolled.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as follows: Each time we start, the count is 0. We roll the die:

- If we roll a 1, we stop, and the final count is the current count (which would be 1, since we rolled once). Wait, no. Wait, the count is the number of times we rolled. So if we start, count is 0. Then we roll once. If that roll is 1, then we stop. The count is 1? Or is the count the number of times we rolled before getting a 1?

Wait, the problem says "count the number of times we roll." So each time we roll, we increment the count. But when we get an even number, we reset the count to zero. So, for example:

- Roll 1: Suppose we roll a 3 (odd, not 1). Count becomes 1. Then we roll again. If we roll a 2 (even), count resets to 0. Then we roll again. If we roll a 1, we stop, and the final count is 1 (since that's the number of rolls since the last reset, which was after the 2). Wait, but the count is reset to zero when we roll an even, so after rolling a 2, the count is 0. Then we roll again, and if that's a 1, the count would be 1 (since we rolled once after the reset). So the final count would be 1 in that case.

But the problem says "the expected number of final counts." So the final count is the count when we stop, which is when we roll a 1. Therefore, the count is the number of rolls since the last reset (including the current roll) when we stop.

Alternatively, maybe the count is the total number of rolls made, but reset to zero whenever an even is rolled. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me re-read the problem.

"We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one. What is the expected number of final counts?"

So, the count is the number of times we rolled. So each time we roll, we add 1 to the count. However, if the result is even, we reset the count to zero. So the count is being tracked, and when an even is rolled, it's set back to zero. But when we roll a 1, we stop, and the count at that point is the final count.

So, for example:

- Roll 1: 2 (even) → count becomes 0.
- Roll 2: 3 (odd) → count becomes 1.
- Roll 3: 1 (stop) → final count is 1.

Another example:

- Roll 1: 4 (even) → count 0.
- Roll 2: 5 (odd) → count 1.
- Roll 3: 2 (even) → count 0.
- Roll 4: 3 (odd) → count 1.
- Roll 5: 1 (stop) → final count 1.

Wait, but in this case, the final count is 1 again. But maybe there are cases where the final count is higher. For example:

- Roll 1: 3 (count 1)
- Roll 2: 3 (count 2)
- Roll 3: 1 (stop) → final count 2.

So the final count can be 1, 2, etc. The question is to find the expected value of this final count.

So, how do we model this? Let's think in terms of expected value. Let E be the expected final count. When we start, the count is 0. But each time we roll, we have different possibilities.

Wait, but when we start, the count is 0. Then we roll the die. Let's think recursively.

Let me define E as the expected final count starting from a count of 0. However, when we start, the count is 0, but the first roll will be counted as 1, unless it's even. Wait, maybe I need to model the expected value based on the current count.

Alternatively, think of it as a Markov chain where each state is the current count. But since the count can be any non-negative integer, it's infinite states. However, perhaps we can find a recursive formula.

Let me think. Suppose we are in a state where the current count is k. Then, when we roll the die:

- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1: then we stop, and the final count is k + 1 (since we just rolled once more). Wait, no. Wait, the count is being tracked as the number of times rolled. So if the current count is k, and we roll a die:

Wait, maybe the count is not the current count, but the number of rolls since the last reset. So, for example, if we are in a state where the count is k (meaning we have rolled k times since the last reset), then:

- Rolling a 1: we stop, and the final count is k + 1 (since we just rolled once more, adding to the count). Wait, but if the count was k, and we roll a die, then the next roll would be the (k+1)th roll. But if that roll is 1, then the final count is k+1. However, if the roll is even, the count resets to 0. If it's odd and not 1, the count increases by 1.

Wait, maybe I need to define E(k) as the expected final count starting from a count of k. Then, our initial state is k=0, and we want E(0).

So, for any k ≥ 0:

E(k) = (probability of rolling 1) * (k + 1) + (probability of rolling even) * E(0) + (probability of rolling odd not 1) * E(k + 1)

Because:

- If we roll a 1 (prob 1/6), then we stop, and the final count is k + 1 (since we added one more roll).
- If we roll an even number (prob 3/6 = 1/2), then the count resets to 0, so the expected final count from there is E(0).
- If we roll an odd number that's not 1 (i.e., 3 or 5, prob 2/6 = 1/3), then the count increases by 1, so we're in state k + 1, and the expected final count is E(k + 1).

So, the equation is:

E(k) = (1/6)(k + 1) + (1/2)E(0) + (1/3)E(k + 1)

But this is for any k ≥ 0. However, we need to find E(0). The problem is that this gives an infinite system of equations. However, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation.

Let me rearrange the equation:

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:

6E(k) = (k + 1) + 3E(0) + 2E(k + 1)

Rearranged:

2E(k + 1) = 6E(k) - (k + 1) - 3E(0)

But this seems complex. However, if we can find a relation between E(k) and E(k + 1), perhaps we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, assume that E(k) = a * k + b, where a and b are constants. Let's test this assumption.

Assume E(k) = a*k + b. Then, substituting into the equation:

a*k + b = (1/6)(k + 1) + (1/2)(a*0 + b) + (1/3)(a*(k + 1) + b)

Simplify the right-hand side:

(1/6)(k + 1) + (1/2)b + (1/3)(a(k + 1) + b)

Let's expand this:

= (k + 1)/6 + b/2 + (a(k + 1) + b)/3

Combine terms:

= [ (k + 1)/6 + a(k + 1)/3 ] + [ b/2 + b/3 ]

Factor out (k + 1):

= (k + 1)[1/6 + a/3] + b[1/2 + 1/3]

Now, equate this to the left-hand side, which is a*k + b:

a*k + b = (k + 1)[1/6 + a/3] + b*(5/6)

Let me expand the right-hand side:

= [1/6 + a/3] * k + [1/6 + a/3] * 1 + (5/6)b

So, grouping terms:

Left side: a*k + b

Right side: [ (1/6 + a/3) ] *k + [ (1/6 + a/3) + (5/6)b ]

Therefore, equate coefficients for k and the constants:

For k:

a = 1/6 + a/3

Solving for a:

a - a/3 = 1/6 → (2a)/3 = 1/6 → a = (1/6) * (3/2) = 1/4

For constants:

b = (1/6 + a/3) + (5/6)b

Substitute a = 1/4:

b = (1/6 + (1/4)/3) + (5/6)b

Calculate (1/4)/3 = 1/12

So:

b = 1/6 + 1/12 + (5/6)b

Convert 1/6 to 2/12, so 2/12 + 1/12 = 3/12 = 1/4

So:

b = 1/4 + (5/6)b

Subtract (5/6)b from both sides:

b - (5/6)b = 1/4 → (1/6)b = 1/4 → b = (1/4) * 6 = 3/2

So, according to this, E(k) = (1/4)k + 3/2

But wait, this is under the assumption that E(k) is linear in k. Let's check if this satisfies the original equation.

Let me test with k=0. Then E(0) = 3/2.

Let me plug into the original equation for E(0):

E(0) = (1/6)(0 + 1) + (1/2)E(0) + (1/3)E(1)

Compute E(1) = (1/4)(1) + 3/2 = 1/4 + 3/2 = 7/4

So:

Left side: E(0) = 3/2

Right side: (1/6)(1) + (1/2)(3/2) + (1/3)(7/4)

Calculate each term:

(1/6) = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667

(1/2)(3/2) = 3/4 = 0.75

(1/3)(7/4) = 7/12 ≈ 0.5833

Adding them up: 1/6 + 3/4 + 7/12

Convert to twelfths:

1/6 = 2/12, 3/4 = 9/12, 7/12 = 7/12

Total: 2 + 9 + 7 = 18/12 = 3/2, which equals the left side. So that works.

Therefore, our assumption that E(k) is linear is correct, and E(k) = (1/4)k + 3/2.

But we need E(0), which is 3/2. However, wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check another value.

Take k=1, E(1)=7/4. Let's plug into the original equation:

E(1) = (1/6)(1 + 1) + (1/2)E(0) + (1/3)E(2)

E(2) = (1/4)(2) + 3/2 = 0.5 + 1.5 = 2

So:

Left side: 7/4 = 1.75

Right side: (1/6)(2) + (1/2)(3/2) + (1/3)(2)

Calculate:

(2/6) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333

(1/2)(3/2) = 3/4 = 0.75

(1/3)(2) = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667

Total: 0.3333 + 0.75 + 0.6667 ≈ 1.75, which is 7/4. Correct again.

So, this seems to hold. Therefore, the expected value starting from k=0 is E(0) = 3/2 = 1.5.

But wait, the problem says "the expected number of final counts." So, according to this, the answer is 3/2 or 1.5. However, let me think again to ensure that I didn't misinterpret the problem.

Wait, the problem says "count the number of times we roll." So each time we roll, we increment the count. However, when we get an even number, we reset the count to zero. So the count is the number of rolls since the last reset. When we get a 1, we stop, and the count at that point is the final count.

But according to our model, E(0) = 3/2. So the expected final count is 1.5. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Let's consider that each time we have a sequence of rolls that don't result in an even number or a 1. Each such sequence ends when we either get a 1 or an even number. The count would be the number of rolls in the sequence when we get a 1.

But since the count resets on even numbers, the process can be seen as a series of trials, each starting from count 0, and each trial ends when either a 1 is rolled (success) or an even is rolled (failure, resetting the count). The expected count would then be the expected number of trials until the first success, multiplied by the expected count per trial.

Wait, but this might not be straightforward. Let's think of each "trial" as a sequence of rolls starting from count 0. Each trial ends when either a 1 or an even is rolled. The probability that a trial ends with a 1 is the probability of rolling a 1 before rolling an even. The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling an even is 1/2. The probability of rolling an odd (3 or 5) is 1/3. So, the probability that the trial ends with a 1 is (1/6) / (1/6 + 1/2) = (1/6) / (2/3) = 1/4. Similarly, the probability that the trial ends with an even is 1/2 / (2/3) = 3/4.

But the expected number of trials until the first success (rolling a 1) is a geometric distribution with success probability p = 1/4. The expected number of trials is 1/p = 4. However, each trial has an expected count. Wait, but the count during each trial is the number of rolls in that trial. For example, if the first trial ends on the first roll with a 1, the count is 1. If it ends on the second roll with a 1, the count is 2, etc. But the trials are independent.

Alternatively, the expected count for each trial is the expected number of rolls in a trial until either a 1 or an even is rolled. Let me compute that.

Let’s denote the expected number of rolls in a single trial as T. Then:

T = 1 + (probability of rolling odd not 1) * T

Because with probability 1/6, we roll a 1 and the trial ends (1 roll), with probability 1/2 we roll an even and the trial ends (1 roll), and with probability 1/3 we roll an odd not 1, and then we have to start over, adding 1 more roll.

Wait, actually, the equation should be:

T = 1 + (probability of rolling odd not 1) * T

Because:

- With probability 1/6 + 1/2 = 2/3, the trial ends after 1 roll.
- With probability 1/3, the trial continues, and we have to add 1 more roll plus the expected T again.

So:

T = 1 + (1/3)T → T - (1/3)T = 1 → (2/3)T = 1 → T = 3/2.

So the expected number of rolls per trial is 3/2. But each trial contributes to the final count only if it ends with a 1. However, the trials are repeated until we get a success (rolling a 1). The expected number of trials is 4, as before. However, the final count is the count from the successful trial. But the count in the successful trial is the number of rolls in that trial, which is a random variable.

Wait, this seems different from the previous approach. Let me think again.

If each trial has an expected number of rolls of 3/2, but only the trials that end with a 1 contribute to the final count. However, the final count is the number of rolls in the successful trial. So the expected final count would be the expected number of rolls in a successful trial.

But how do we compute that?

Let me denote that in a trial, the probability that it ends with a 1 is p = 1/4, and the probability it ends with an even is q = 3/4. The expected number of rolls in a trial is T = 3/2 as before. However, the expected number of rolls in a successful trial (ending with 1) is different from T. Let me compute that.

Let’s define E as the expected number of rolls in a trial that ends with a 1. Then:

E = (probability of rolling 1 on first roll) * 1 + (probability of rolling odd not 1) * (1 + E)

Because:

- If we roll a 1 (prob 1/6), the trial ends with 1 roll.
- If we roll an odd not 1 (prob 1/3), we have 1 roll plus the expected E again.
- If we roll an even (prob 1/2), the trial ends, but it's not a success, so it doesn't contribute to E.

So the equation is:

E = (1/6)*1 + (1/3)*(1 + E)

Solving:

E = 1/6 + (1/3) + (1/3)E → E = 1/6 + 1/3 + (1/3)E → E = 1/2 + (1/3)E → E - (1/3)E = 1/2 → (2/3)E = 1/2 → E = (1/2) * (3/2) = 3/4.

So the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is 3/4. However, the expected number of trials until the first success is 4. Therefore, the overall expected final count would be 4 * 3/4 = 3. Wait, that contradicts the previous result of 3/2. Which is correct?

This is confusing. Which approach is right?

In the first approach, we modeled E(k) as the expected final count starting from count k, and found E(0) = 3/2. In the second approach, using trials, we get 3. These are conflicting results. There must be an error in one of the approaches.

Let me check the second approach again. The key is that the final count is the number of rolls in the successful trial. The expected number of trials until the first success is 4, but each trial that is not successful doesn't contribute to the final count. Only the successful trial contributes its count. However, the expected count of the successful trial is 3/4. Therefore, the total expected final count is 3/4, not 4 * 3/4. Because the number of trials is a random variable, but only the last trial (the successful one) contributes to the count. Therefore, the expected final count is just the expected count of a single successful trial, which is 3/4. But this contradicts the first approach.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the definitions. Let's think again.

In the first approach, the expected value E(0) is 3/2. Let's simulate a simple case. Suppose we always roll a 1 on the first roll. The probability is 1/6, and the final count is 1. If we roll an even on the first roll, probability 1/2, then the count resets to 0, and we start over. If we roll a 3 or 5, probability 1/3, then the count becomes 1, and we continue.

So, the equation for E(0) is:

E(0) = (1/6)(1) + (1/2)E(0) + (1/3)E(1)

And E(1) = (1/6)(2) + (1/2)E(0) + (1/3)E(2)

And so on. Which led us to E(k) = (1/4)k + 3/2, so E(0) = 3/2.

But according to the second approach, the expected final count is 3/4. These results are different. So which is correct?

Let me take a simple case where we have only two possible outcomes: 1 or even. Suppose we ignore the 3 and 5. Let's say the die has only 1, 2, and 3. Then, the probability of 1 is 1/3, even (2) is 1/3, and odd not 1 (3) is 1/3. Let's compute E(0) using the first approach.

Equation for E(0):

E(0) = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)E(0) + (1/3)E(1)

Similarly, E(1) = (1/3)(2) + (1/3)E(0) + (1/3)E(2)

Assuming E(k) = a*k + b.

Plug into E(0):

a*0 + b = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(a*0 + b) + (1/3)(a*1 + b)

Simplify:

b = 1/3 + (1/3)b + (a/3 + b/3)

Multiply all terms by 3:

3b = 1 + b + a + b → 3b = 1 + 2b + a → b = 1 + a.

For E(k) = a*k + b, and the equation for E(1):

a*1 + b = (1/3)(2) + (1/3)(b) + (1/3)(a*2 + b)

Simplify:

a + b = 2/3 + b/3 + (2a + b)/3

Multiply all terms by 3:

3a + 3b = 2 + b + 2a + b → 3a + 3b = 2 + 2a + 2b → 3a + 3b - 2a - 2b = 2 → a + b = 2.

From earlier, we had b = 1 + a. Substitute into this:

a + (1 + a) = 2 → 2a + 1 = 2 → 2a = 1 → a = 1/2, then b = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.

So E(0) = 3/2. But let's compute it manually for this simplified case.

In this simplified case, the expected final count is 3/2. Let's see if that makes sense.

If we always roll 1 on the first try: probability 1/3, count 1.

If we roll 2 (even): probability 1/3, reset to 0, and then expected E(0) again.

If we roll 3: probability 1/3, count becomes 1, then we continue.

So the equation is E(0) = 1/3 * 1 + 1/3 * E(0) + 1/3 * E(1).

And E(1) = 1/3 * 2 + 1/3 * E(0) + 1/3 * E(2).

Assuming the pattern continues, and solving gives E(0) = 3/2.

But if we use the second approach, what would happen?

In this simplified case, the probability of success (rolling 1) in a trial is p = 1/3, and the probability of failure (even) is q = 1/3, and probability of continuing is r = 1/3.

The expected number of trials until success is 1/p = 3. The expected number of rolls in a successful trial is calculated as follows:

Let E be the expected number of rolls in a successful trial. Then:

E = (probability of success on first roll) * 1 + (probability of continue) * (1 + E)

So:

E = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(1 + E) → E = 1/3 + 1/3 + (1/3)E → E = 2/3 + (1/3)E → (2/3)E = 2/3 → E = 1.

Then, the expected final count would be E = 1. But according to the first approach, it's 3/2. Contradiction again. So which is correct?

Let me simulate this simplified case manually.

Let's compute E(0) manually. Let's denote E(0) as the expected final count.

E(0) = 1/3 * 1 + 1/3 * E(0) + 1/3 * E(1)

E(1) = 1/3 * 2 + 1/3 * E(0) + 1/3 * E(2)

E(2) = 1/3 * 3 + 1/3 * E(0) + 1/3 * E(3)

And so on.

Assuming the pattern E(k) = a*k + b, and we found a = 1/2, b = 3/2, so E(k) = (1/2)k + 3/2.

So E(0) = 3/2, E(1) = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, E(2) = 1 + 3/2 = 5/2, etc.

Let me plug E(1) = 2 into the equation for E(0):

E(0) = 1/3 * 1 + 1/3 * E(0) + 1/3 * 2

E(0) = 1/3 + (1/3)E(0) + 2/3

E(0) = (1/3 + 2/3) + (1/3)E(0) → E(0) = 1 + (1/3)E(0)

Subtract (1/3)E(0):

(2/3)E(0) = 1 → E(0) = 3/2. Correct.

But according to the second approach, it should be 1. So why the discrepancy?

The second approach assumes that the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is 1, but according to the first approach, it's 3/2. Which is correct?

Let me compute the expected number of rolls in a successful trial manually. In this simplified case, the trials are sequences of rolls that end when either 1 or 2 is rolled. The successful trials are those that end with 1. Let's compute the expected number of rolls in such a trial.

Let E be the expected number of rolls in a successful trial.

When we start a trial:

- With probability 1/3, we roll a 1, and the trial ends with 1 roll.
- With probability 1/3, we roll a 2, and the trial ends (but it's not a success).
- With probability 1/3, we roll a 3, and we have to continue, adding 1 roll plus the expected E again.

So the equation is:

E = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(0) + (1/3)*(1 + E)

Wait, but the (1/3)*(0) is because if we roll a 2, the trial ends but it's not a success, so it doesn't contribute to E. However, in this case, E is the expected number of rolls in a successful trial, so we need to condition on the trial being successful.

Ah! Here's the mistake. The second approach earlier didn't condition on the trial being successful. The correct way is to compute E as the expected number of rolls in a successful trial, which means we have to condition on the trial being successful.

So, the probability that a trial is successful is p = 1/3 (rolling 1) divided by (p + q) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. Wait, no, the trial is successful if it ends with 1, which has probability 1/3, and the trial ends with 2 (failure) with probability 1/3. So the probability that a trial is successful is 1/3 divided by (1/3 + 1/3) = 1/2. Wait, no, the trial is either successful or not, and the probability of success is 1/3, and the probability of failure is 1/3, and the probability of continuing is 1/3.

But to compute E, the expected number of rolls in a successful trial, we need to consider only the trials that end successfully. So, the expected number of rolls is:

E = sum_{n=1}^∞ P(trial ends on nth roll with success) * n

But this might be complex. Alternatively, use conditional expectation.

Let me define E as the expected number of rolls in a successful trial. Then, when we start a trial:

- With probability 1/3, we roll a 1 (success), and the number of rolls is 1.
- With probability 1/3, we roll a 2 (failure), and the trial doesn't contribute to E.
- With probability 1/3, we roll a 3, and then we have to continue, and the expected number of rolls becomes 1 + E (since we've already used 1 roll and now expect E more rolls in the successful trial).

But since we are conditioning on the trial being successful, the probability of success is 1/3, and the probability of continuing is 1/3. So the equation should be:

E = [ (1/3) * 1 + (1/3) * (1 + E) ] / P(trial is successful)

Wait, no. The correct way is to use the law of total expectation. Let me think again.

Let me denote that in a trial, the probability that it is successful is p = 1/3, and the probability it is not successful is q = 1/3, and the probability it continues is r = 1/3.

The expected number of rolls in a successful trial is E. Then, the expected number of rolls in any trial (successful or not) is T = 1 + r*T, which gives T = 3/2 as before.

But E is the expected number of rolls in a successful trial. To compute this, we can use the fact that the probability of success is p = 1/3, and the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is E = [expected number of rolls in a trial given that it is successful].

This can be calculated as E = [expected number of rolls in a trial * probability of success] / probability of success? No, that doesn't make sense.

Actually, the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is the expected number of rolls in all trials, weighted by the probability that the trial is successful.

Alternatively, consider that the expected number of rolls in a successful trial is E, and the expected number of rolls in a trial that is not successful is F. Then, the overall expected number
