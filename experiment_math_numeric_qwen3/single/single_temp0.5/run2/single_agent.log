</think>

To solve the problem, we are given two concentric circles centered at point $ D $, with radii 1 and 2. The shaded region is composed of two parts, and its total area is $ \frac{5}{12} $ of the area of the larger circle. We are asked to find the measure of the smaller angle $ \angle ADC $, where points $ A $ and $ C $ lie on the larger circle.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry

- The larger circle has radius $ R = 2 $, so its area is:
  $$
  \text{Area}_{\text{large}} = \pi R^2 = \pi (2)^2 = 4\pi
  $$

- The shaded area is $ \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5}{3} \pi $

- The shaded region consists of:
  - **Region 1**: The area between the two arcs (from the larger and smaller circles) within the angle $ \angle ADC $
  - **Region 2**: A sector of the smaller circle (radius 1) with the same central angle $ \theta = \angle ADC $

---

### Step 2: Express the Shaded Area in Terms of $ \theta $

Let $ \theta $ be the measure of $ \angle ADC $ in degrees.

- **Area of the larger sector** (radius 2):
  $$
  \text{Area}_{\text{large sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi (2)^2 = \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot 4\pi
  $$

- **Area of the smaller sector** (radius 1):
  $$
  \text{Area}_{\text{small sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi (1)^2 = \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi
  $$

- **Area of Region 1** (difference of the two sectors):
  $$
  \text{Area}_{\text{Region 1}} = \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot 4\pi - \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi = \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot 3\pi
  $$

- **Area of Region 2** (the smaller sector):
  $$
  \text{Area}_{\text{Region 2}} = \frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi
  $$

- **Total shaded area**:
  $$
  \text{Total shaded area} = \frac{3\pi\theta}{360} + \frac{\pi\theta}{360} = \frac{4\pi\theta}{360} = \frac{\pi\theta}{90}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ \theta $

We are told that the shaded area is $ \frac{5}{3} \pi $, so:

$$
\frac{\pi\theta}{90} = \frac{5}{3} \pi
$$

Divide both sides by $ \pi $:

$$
\frac{\theta}{90} = \frac{5}{3}
$$

Multiply both sides by 90:

$$
\theta = \frac{5}{3} \cdot 90 = 150
$$

---

### Step 4: Interpret the Result

Since $ \theta = \angle ADC = 150^\circ $, and the question asks for the **smaller** angle, we check whether this is indeed the smaller angle. The full angle around point $ D $ is $ 360^\circ $, and the angle $ \angle ADC $ is between two points on the circle, so the smaller angle between the two points is $ \theta $ if $ \theta < 180^\circ $, and $ 360^\circ - \theta $ otherwise.

Here, $ \theta = 150^\circ < 180^\circ $, so it is the smaller angle.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{150}

6*0 + 9*12 + 9*8 + 6*0 = 0 + 108 + 72 + 0 = 180

Then sum y_i * x_{i+1}:

0*9 + 0*9 + 12*6 + 8*6 = 0 + 0 + 72 + 48 = 120

Subtract the two: |180 - 120| = 60. Then divide by 2: 60/2 = 30. So the area is 30. That confirms it. So the answer is 30.

But wait, the problem mentions "square centimeters". The Asymptote code's labels are in numbers, but the actual units might be in centimeters. However, since the problem says "the number of square centimeters", and the diagram's labels are given as numbers, I think the answer is 30. Therefore, the answer should be 30.

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 25. Extracted: {k+1} * k. Because for k=1: (-1)^{2}*1=1, k=2: (-1)^3*2=-2, etc. So that's the same as the given expression.

There's a formula for the sum of an alternating series like this. For the sum S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + (-1)^{n+1} n.

If n is odd, then the sum can be calculated as (n + 1)/2. Wait, let me check with previous examples. For n=3: (3+1)/2=2, which matches. For n=5: (5+1)/2=3, which matches. For n=1: (1+1)/2=1, correct. So if this formula is correct, then for n=2007, the sum would be (2007 + 1)/2 = 2008/2 = 1004. Which matches the previous result. So that confirms it.

But where does this formula come from? Let me derive it. Let's suppose n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1, where m is an integer. Then the sum S is:

(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (2m-1 - 2m) + (2m+1).

Each pair (1-2), (3-4), etc., is -1. There are m such pairs. So the sum is m*(-1) + (2m+1) = -m + 2m +1 = m +1. Since n = 2m +1, m = (n -1)/2. Therefore, substituting back, S = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n -1 + 2)/2 = (n +1)/2. So yes, that's the formula. Therefore, for n odd, the sum is (n+1)/2. Therefore, for n=2007, it's (2007 +1)/2 = 2008/2 = 1004. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, if n is even, say n=2m, then the sum is m pairs of (1-2)+(3-4)+...+(2m-1 -2m) = m*(-1) = -m. Which would be -n/2.

So that formula works. Therefore, the answer is 1004. So I think that's solid. Both methods agree. So I can be confident that the answer is 1004.

{"reasoning": "The expression alternates adding and subtracting consecutive integers up to 2007. Since 2007 is odd, the series can be grouped into 1003 pairs of (1 - 2), (3 - 4), ..., (2005 - 2006), each summing to -1, and a final term of 2007. The total is 1003 * (-1) + 2007 = 2007 - 1003 = 1004. This aligns with the general formula for the sum of such an alternating series when n is odd: (n + 1)/2.", "answer": 1004}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {n+2} = z_{n+1}² * z_n for all n ≥ 1.
3. For all n ≥ 1, the ratio z_{n+3}/z_n² is real.
4. The absolute values |z₃/z₄| = |z₄/z₅| = 2.

We need to find the product of all possible values of z₁.

Alright, let's start by writing down the recurrence relation and see if we can express terms in terms of z₁ and z₂. Maybe that will help us find relations between them.

Given z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}² * z_n.

Let me compute the first few terms:

z₁ is given.

z₂ is given.

z₃ = z₂² * z₁.

z₄ = z₃² * z₂ = (z₂² z₁)² * z₂ = z₂⁴ z₁² * z₂ = z₂⁵ z₁².

Wait, let me check that again. z₄ is z₃² * z₂. Since z₃ = z₂² z₁, then z₃² is (z₂² z₁)² = z₂⁴ z₁². Multiply by z₂ gives z₂⁴ z₁² * z₂ = z₂⁵ z₁². Yes, that's correct.

Then z₅ = z₄² * z₃. Let's compute that:

z₄² = (z₂⁵ z₁²)² = z₂¹⁰ z₁⁴. Multiply by z₃ which is z₂² z₁: z₂¹⁰ z₁⁴ * z₂² z₁ = z₂¹² z₁⁵.

So z₅ = z₂¹² z₁⁵.

Similarly, z₆ would be z₅² * z₄ = (z₂¹² z₁⁵)² * z₂⁵ z₁² = z₂²⁴ z₁¹⁰ * z₂⁵ z₁² = z₂²⁹ z₁¹².

But maybe we don't need to go that far. Let's see what the other conditions tell us.

The third condition says that z_{n+3}/z_n² is real for all n ≥ 1. Let's check for n=1, n=2, etc.

Starting with n=1: z_{4}/z₁² is real.

Similarly, n=2: z_{5}/z₂² is real.

n=3: z_{6}/z₃² is real, etc. But maybe the first few will be enough.

Let me compute z₄/z₁². From above, z₄ = z₂⁵ z₁², so z₄/z₁² = z₂⁵. Therefore, z₂⁵ is real. Similarly, z₅/z₂² = (z₂¹² z₁⁵)/z₂² = z₂¹⁰ z₁⁵. This must be real. Also, for n=1, z_{4}/z₁² is real, which we already said is z₂⁵ is real. Similarly, for n=2, z_{5}/z₂² is real, which is z₂¹⁰ z₁⁵ is real.

But also, for n=3, z_{6}/z₃². Let me compute that. z₆ is z₂²⁹ z₁¹², z₃² is (z₂² z₁)² = z₂⁴ z₁². So z₆/z₃² = z₂²⁹ z₁¹² / (z₂⁴ z₁²) = z₂²⁵ z₁¹⁰. Which must be real. But maybe there's a pattern here.

But perhaps we can find relations between z₁ and z₂ from these conditions.

First, z₂⁵ is real. So z₂⁵ ∈ ℝ. Similarly, z₂¹⁰ z₁⁵ is real. Also, z₂²⁵ z₁¹⁰ is real. Let me note that z₂⁵ is real. Let me denote that.

Let me write that z₂⁵ is real. Therefore, z₂ is a complex number such that when raised to the 5th power, it becomes real. Similarly, z₁ is a complex number such that when combined with z₂, certain expressions are real.

But maybe we can express z₂ in polar form. Let me think.

Let me suppose that z₂ is a complex number. Since z₂⁵ is real, then z₂ must be a real number or have an argument that is a multiple of π/5. Wait, more precisely, if z₂ is written in polar form as r₂ e^{iθ}, then z₂⁵ = r₂⁵ e^{i5θ} is real. Therefore, e^{i5θ} must be real, which implies that 5θ ≡ 0 mod π, so θ ≡ 0 mod π/5. Therefore, θ = kπ/5 for some integer k. Therefore, z₂ lies on a line in the complex plane with angles multiples of π/5. However, since z₂ is not real (given that z₁ and z₂ are not real), then θ cannot be 0 or π. Therefore, θ must be π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, etc., but since angles are modulo 2π, we can take θ ∈ {π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 7π/5, 8π/5, 9π/5} (excluding 0 and π). However, since angles differing by π would be negatives, but since we are squaring and multiplying, perhaps some of these are equivalent. Anyway, maybe we can note that z₂^5 is real, so z₂^5 = ±r₂^5, where r₂ is the modulus of z₂.

But maybe we can write z₂^5 = real number. Let me denote that as z₂^5 = a, where a is real.

Similarly, looking at the second condition: z₂^10 z₁^15 is real. Let me note that z₂^10 = (z₂^5)^2 = a², which is real. Therefore, z₂^10 z₁^15 = a² z₁^15 must be real. Therefore, z₁^15 must be real, since a² is real. Therefore, z₁^15 is real. Similarly, for the third condition, z₂^25 z₁^10 is real. Let's see: z₂^25 = (z₂^5)^5 = a^5, which is real. Therefore, z₂^25 z₁^10 = a^5 z₁^10 must be real. Therefore, z₁^10 must be real. Wait, but z₁^15 is real and z₁^10 is real. Let me think about that.

If z₁^15 is real and z₁^10 is real, then z₁^15 = z₁^10 * z₁^5. Since both z₁^15 and z₁^10 are real, then z₁^5 must be real. Because if z₁^10 is real and z₁^15 is real, then z₁^15 / z₁^10 = z₁^5 is real. Therefore, z₁^5 is real. Therefore, z₁^5 is real, z₁^10 is real, z₁^15 is real. So z₁^5 is real. Therefore, similar to z₂, z₁ must be such that z₁^5 is real. Therefore, z₁ is a complex number with argument θ such that 5θ ≡ 0 mod π, i.e., θ ≡ 0 mod π/5. But z₁ is not real, so θ ≠ 0 mod π. Therefore, similar to z₂, z₁ has argument π/5, 2π/5, etc., as above.

So both z₁ and z₂ have arguments that are multiples of π/5, but not multiples of π. Therefore, they lie on the complex plane with angles π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, etc.

But maybe we can write z₁ and z₂ in polar form. Let me try that.

Let me denote z₁ = r₁ e^{iα}, z₂ = r₂ e^{iβ}, where α and β are angles not multiples of π (since z₁ and z₂ are not real), and 5α ≡ 0 mod π, 5β ≡ 0 mod π. Therefore, α = kπ/5, β = mπ/5, where k and m are integers not divisible by 5 (since if k is divisible by 5, then α would be multiple of π, making z₁ real, which is not allowed). Wait, actually, if α is kπ/5, then if k is 0 or 5, then α would be 0 or π, which would make z₁ real. But since z₁ is not real, then k cannot be 0 or 5 mod 5. So k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} mod 5. Similarly for m.

But maybe we can proceed with this.

Now, moving on to the fourth condition: |z₃/z₄| = |z₄/z₅| = 2.

Let me compute |z₃/z₄| and |z₄/z₅|.

First, z₃ = z₂² z₁.

z₄ = z₂⁵ z₁².

Therefore, z₃/z₄ = (z₂² z₁) / (z₂⁵ z₁²) ) = 1/(z₂³ z₁).

Therefore, |z₃/z₄| = 1/( |z₂³ z₁| ) = 1/( |z₂|³ |z₁| ). And this is equal to 2. Therefore:

1/( |z₂|³ |z₁| ) = 2 ⇒ |z₂|³ |z₁| = 1/2. (Equation 1)

Similarly, compute |z₄/z₅|. z₄/z₅ = (z₂⁵ z₁²) / (z₂¹² z₁⁵) ) = 1/(z₂⁷ z₁³). Therefore, |z₄/z₅| = 1/( |z₂|⁷ |z₁|³ ) = 2. Hence:

1/( |z₂|⁷ |z₁|³ ) = 2 ⇒ |z₂|⁷ |z₁|³ = 1/2. (Equation 2)

So now we have two equations:

Equation 1: |z₂|³ |z₁| = 1/2

Equation 2: |z₂|⁷ |z₁|³ = 1/2

Let me denote |z₁| = a, |z₂| = b. Then:

Equation 1: b³ a = 1/2

Equation 2: b⁷ a³ = 1/2

So we have:

From equation 1: a = 1/(2 b³)

Substitute into equation 2:

b⁷ * [1/(2 b³)]³ = 1/2

Compute [1/(2 b³)]³ = 1/(8 b^9)

Therefore:

b⁷ * 1/(8 b^9) = 1/(8 b²) = 1/2 ⇒ 1/(8 b²) = 1/2 ⇒ 8 b² = 2 ⇒ b² = 2/8 = 1/4 ⇒ b = 1/2 or b = -1/2. But since modulus is non-negative, b = 1/2.

Therefore, |z₂| = 1/2.

Then from equation 1: ( (1/2)^3 ) * a = 1/2 ⇒ (1/8) a = 1/2 ⇒ a = (1/2) * 8 = 4. Therefore, |z₁| = 4.

So we have |z₁| = 4 and |z₂| = 1/2.

So that's the modulus part. Now, we need to find the arguments of z₁ and z₂, considering the earlier conditions.

Earlier, we had that z₁^5 is real and z₂^5 is real. Let me recall that.

So z₁^5 is real. Therefore, as I mentioned earlier, the argument of z₁, let's call it α, must satisfy 5α ≡ 0 mod π. Therefore, α = kπ/5, where k is an integer not divisible by 5 (to ensure z₁ is not real). Similarly for β, the argument of z₂.

Moreover, we have the condition that z_{n+3}/z_n² is real for all n ≥ 1. For n=1, we saw that z₄/z₁² = z₂⁵ is real. Which we already considered. For n=2, z₅/z₂² is real. Which we had as z₂¹⁰ z₁¹⁵ is real. But since z₂^5 is real, z₂^10 is real. And z₁^15 is real (from earlier). Therefore, their product is real. Similarly for other n. But maybe there are more constraints?

Wait, but perhaps there's another condition from the recurrence? Let me check for n=3. z_{6}/z₃² is real. Which we had as z₂²⁵ z₁¹⁰ is real. Since z₂^5 is real, z₂^25 = (z₂^5)^5 is real. And z₁^10 is real. So their product is real. So that's already covered. So maybe those conditions are already satisfied given that z₁^5 and z₂^5 are real. Therefore, perhaps the only constraints on the arguments are that 5α and 5β are multiples of π, and z₁ and z₂ are not real. Therefore, α and β are π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, etc., but not multiples of π.

But there's another condition: the ratio z_{n+3}/z_n² is real. Wait, but we already used that for n=1 and n=2, but maybe there's more? Let me think. However, since we have already derived that z₁^5 and z₂^5 are real, which seems to satisfy all the conditions for z_{n+3}/z_n² being real for all n. Therefore, maybe those are the only constraints. However, perhaps there is another relation between α and β?

Wait, let's think again. Let me check for n=1: z_{4}/z₁² is real. Which is z₂^5. Since z₂^5 is real, that's okay. For n=2: z_{5}/z₂² is real. Which is z₂^{10} z₁^{15} is real. Since z₂^5 is real, z₂^{10} is real. And z₁^5 is real, so z₁^{15} = (z₁^5)^3 is real. Therefore, the product is real. Similarly for n=3, etc. Therefore, as long as z₁^5 and z₂^5 are real, all those ratios will be real. Therefore, the only constraints are that z₁^5 and z₂^5 are real, and z₁, z₂ are not real.

Therefore, the arguments α and β must satisfy 5α ≡ 0 mod π, and 5β ≡ 0 mod π. Which gives α = π/5 * k, β = π/5 * m, where k and m are integers not divisible by 5 (to ensure that z₁ and z₂ are not real). However, we might need to consider that the arguments could be in different branches, but since angles are modulo 2π, we can take k and m in {1,2,3,4} mod 5, but considering that angles differing by π would be equivalent in terms of their realness? Wait, no. For example, if α = π/5, then z₁ is not real. If α = 6π/5, which is equivalent to π/5 + π, then z₁ would have argument π/5 + π, which is in the third quadrant, still not real. Similarly, angles like 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 7π/5, 8π/5, 9π/5, etc., all not multiples of π. Therefore, possible values for α and β are multiples of π/5, not multiples of π.

But perhaps there's another relation between α and β? Let me check. Because the problem says that z₁ and z₂ are not real, but maybe there's more constraints from the recurrence?

Wait, let me think again. The recurrence is z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 * z_n. So maybe there's some relation between the arguments of z₁ and z₂?

Let me compute the argument of z₃. Since z₃ = z₂² z₁. The argument of z₃ is 2β + α. Similarly, the argument of z₄ is 2*(argument of z₃) + β? Wait no, z₄ = z₃² * z₂. So argument of z₄ is 2*(argument of z₃) + β. Which is 2*(2β + α) + β = 4β + 2α + β = 5β + 2α.

Similarly, argument of z₅ = 2*(argument of z₄) + argument of z₃. Which is 2*(5β + 2α) + (2β + α) = 10β + 4α + 2β + α = 12β + 5α.

But since z_{n+3}/z_n² is real, which means that the argument of z_{n+3}/z_n² is 0 mod π. Let me check for n=1: z₄/z₁². The argument of z₄/z₁² is argument(z₄) - 2*argument(z₁) = (5β + 2α) - 2α = 5β. Which must be 0 mod π. Which is consistent with our previous conclusion that 5β is multiple of π, so that's already considered. Similarly, for n=2: z₅/z₂². The argument is argument(z₅) - 2*argument(z₂) = (12β + 5α) - 2β = 10β + 5α. Which must be 0 mod π. But since 5β is 0 mod π, let me denote 5β = kπ for some integer k. Similarly, 5α = mπ for some integer m. Therefore, 10β + 5α = 2*(5β) + 5α = 2kπ + mπ = (2k + m)π, which is 0 mod π. Therefore, this condition is automatically satisfied. Similarly, for other n, the arguments would also satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are no additional constraints on α and β beyond 5α and 5β being multiples of π.

Therefore, the only constraints are:

- |z₁| = 4, |z₂| = 1/2.

- 5α ≡ 0 mod π, 5β ≡ 0 mod π, with α and β not multiples of π.

But we need to find all possible z₁, considering that z₁ and z₂ are not real, and then find the product of all possible z₁.

But how do we relate α and β? Are there any more constraints?

Wait, perhaps from the recurrence relation? Let me check.

Wait, the problem didn't specify any other conditions except the ones given. So maybe α and β can be any angles such that 5α and 5β are multiples of π, and z₁ and z₂ are not real. However, perhaps there's a relation between α and β because of the recurrence? Let me think.

Wait, but the recurrence is already accounted for in the earlier conditions. For example, we derived the relations on the moduli and the arguments based on the conditions given. So perhaps α and β are independent? But then, how do we determine possible values of z₁?

But the problem says "the product of all possible values of z₁". So there must be some constraints that relate α and β, otherwise there would be infinitely many possible z₁ (since α could be any angle π/5, 2π/5, etc., and similarly for β). However, the problem says "the product of all possible values of z₁", which suggests that there are finitely many possibilities for z₁. Therefore, there must be some additional constraints that we haven't considered yet.

Wait, let me check again. The problem says that z₁ and z₂ are not real. But we also have that z_{n+3}/z_n² is real for all n ≥ 1. However, we already used that for n=1 and n=2, but maybe for other n?

Wait, for example, take n=3: z_{6}/z_3² is real. Let me compute the argument of z_{6}/z_3². Let me compute z₆ first.

Earlier, I had z₆ = z₂²⁹ z₁¹². But maybe it's easier to compute the argument. Let me compute the argument of z₆.

From the recurrence:

z₁: arg(z₁) = α

z₂: arg(z₂) = β

z₃: arg(z₃) = 2β + α

z₄: arg(z₄) = 2*(arg(z₃)) + β = 2*(2β + α) + β = 5β + 2α

z₅: arg(z₅) = 2*(arg(z₄)) + arg(z₃) = 2*(5β + 2α) + (2β + α) = 10β + 4α + 2β + α = 12β + 5α

z₆: arg(z₆) = 2*(arg(z₅)) + arg(z₄) = 2*(12β + 5α) + (5β + 2α) = 24β + 10α + 5β + 2α = 29β + 12α

Then z₃² has argument 2*(arg(z₃)) = 2*(2β + α) = 4β + 2α.

Therefore, the argument of z₆/z₃² is (29β + 12α) - (4β + 2α) = 25β + 10α. Which must be 0 mod π.

But since 5β and 5α are multiples of π, let me write 5β = kπ and 5α = mπ for integers k and m. Then 25β + 10α = 5*(5β) + 2*(5α) = 5kπ + 2mπ = (5k + 2m)π, which is 0 mod π. Therefore, this condition is automatically satisfied. Therefore, no new constraints here.

Therefore, it seems that the only constraints are:

- |z₁| = 4, |z₂| = 1/2

- 5α and 5β are multiples of π, with α and β not multiples of π.

But how does this relate to the possible values of z₁? It seems that z₁ can be any complex number with modulus 4 and argument π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 7π/5, 8π/5, 9π/5 (since those are the angles that are multiples of π/5 but not multiples of π). However, there must be some relation between α and β because z₁ and z₂ are connected through the recurrence relation. Wait, but how?

Wait, but the problem doesn't give us any direct relation between z₁ and z₂ except through the recurrence and the given conditions. However, we have already used all the given conditions. The only thing left is that z₁ and z₂ are not real, which we already considered.

But if there are no further constraints, then z₁ could be any of the 8 possible roots (since angles π/5, 2π/5, ..., 9π/5 excluding multiples of π) with modulus 4. However, the problem says "the product of all possible values of z₁". If there are multiple possible z₁, then their product would depend on how many there are and their positions.

But this seems conflicting with the problem's requirement for a unique answer. Therefore, there must be some missing constraints.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe there's a relation between α and β that we haven't considered yet. Let me check the earlier equations.

We have that z_{n+3}/z_n² is real for all n ≥ 1. For example, take n=1: z₄/z₁² is real, which is z₂⁵. Since z₂⁵ is real, that's okay. But also, for n=2: z₅/z₂² is real, which is z₂¹⁰ z₁¹⁵. But z₂¹⁰ is real, and z₁¹⁵ is real. However, z₁¹⁵ is (z₁^5)^3, and since z₁^5 is real, that's real. So that's okay. But is there any relation between z₁ and z₂?

Wait, but z₁ and z₂ are independent except for the modulus constraints. Unless there's something else.

Wait, but the problem says "the sequence (z_n) of complex numbers satisfies the following properties". So maybe there's a hidden constraint that the sequence must be well-defined? But since we already have the recurrence, and the conditions on the ratios, I don't see another constraint.

Alternatively, maybe there's something about the arguments that we haven't considered. Let me think. For example, if we look at the ratio z₃/z₄ = 1/(z₂³ z₁), which we said had modulus 1/( |z₂|³ |z₁| ) = 2. But what about the argument? Since |z₃/z₄| is given as 2, but the problem doesn't specify the argument, only the modulus. Similarly for |z₄/z₅| = 2. However, since the problem didn't specify the actual value of z₃/z₄ or z₄/z₅, only their moduli, maybe there's no constraint on their arguments. Therefore, the arguments could be anything as long as the moduli are satisfied. Hence, z₁ and z₂ can have any angles as long as their 5th powers are real and they are not real.

But then, if that's the case, z₁ can be any of the 8 roots (modulus 4, angles π/5, 2π/5, ..., 9π/5 excluding multiples of π). However, the product of all possible z₁ would be the product of all these roots. Let me think about that.

If z₁ can be any of the 8 roots, then the product would be the product of all 8 roots. However, these roots are the 5th roots of real numbers. Wait, but z₁^5 is real. Let me note that z₁^5 is real, so z₁^5 = ± |z₁|^5. Since |z₁| = 4, then z₁^5 = ±4^5 = ±1024. Therefore, z₁ are the 5th roots of ±1024. However, since z₁ is not real, we need to exclude the real roots.

The 5th roots of 1024 are 4 e^{i(2πk)/5} for k=0,1,2,3,4. Similarly, the 5th roots of -1024 are 4 e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} = 4 e^{iπ(1 + 2k)/5} for k=0,1,2,3,4. However, note that some of these might overlap.

But since z₁^5 is real, it can be either positive or negative. So z₁^5 = ±1024. Therefore, the possible z₁ are the 5th roots of 1024 and the 5th roots of -1024, excluding the real ones.

Let me count the number of possible z₁.

First, the 5th roots of 1024: there are 5 roots. The real one is 4 (since 4^5 = 1024). The other four are complex: e^{i2π/5}, e^{i4π/5}, e^{i6π/5}, e^{i8π/5} multiplied by 4.

Similarly, the 5th roots of -1024: since -1024 = 1024 e^{iπ}, the roots are 4 e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k=0,1,2,3,4. These angles are π/5, 3π/5, 5π/5=π, 7π/5, 9π/5. The real root here is when k=2: angle π, which is -4. So excluding that, the other four roots are at angles π/5, 3π/5, 7π/5, 9π/5, multiplied by 4.

Therefore, combining both cases, the possible non-real z₁ are:

From 1024: 4 e^{i2π/5}, 4 e^{i4π/5}, 4 e^{i6π/5}, 4 e^{i8π/5}

From -1024: 4 e^{iπ/5}, 4 e^{i3π/5}, 4 e^{i7π/5}, 4 e^{i9π/5}

So total of 8 possible values for z₁. Therefore, the product of all possible z₁ is the product of these 8 complex numbers.

Let me compute this product. Let's note that these are all the 5th roots of ±1024 except the real ones. Alternatively, we can think of them as the roots of the equation z^5 = ±1024, excluding the real roots.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the product. Let me recall that for roots of unity, the product of all roots is (-1)^n times the constant term, but here it's not exactly roots of unity, but scaled versions.

Alternatively, note that the product of all 5th roots of 1024 is 1024^{5/5} = 1024, but since we are excluding the real root (which is 4), the product of the remaining four roots would be 1024 / 4 = 256.

Similarly, for the 5th roots of -1024, the product of all five roots is (-1024)^{5/5} = -1024. Excluding the real root (-4), the product of the remaining four roots is (-1024)/(-4) = 256.

Therefore, the total product of all 8 non-real z₁ is 256 * 256 = 256² = 65536.

Wait, but let me verify this.

Let me think about the product of all non-real 5th roots of 1024 and -1024.

First, consider the equation z^5 = 1024. The roots are 4, 4ω, 4ω², 4ω³, 4ω⁴, where ω = e^{2πi/5}. The product of all roots is 1024. The product of the non-real roots is 1024 / 4 = 256.

Similarly, for z^5 = -1024. The roots are -4, -4ω, -4ω², -4ω³, -4ω⁴. Wait, no. Let me think again. The roots of z^5 = -1024 are the same as the roots of z^5 = 1024 multiplied by e^{iπ/5}? No, better to write -1024 = 1024 e^{iπ}. Therefore, the roots are 4 e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k=0,...,4. Which is 4 e^{iπ/5}, 4 e^{i3π/5}, 4 e^{i5π/5}=4 e^{iπ}=-4, 4 e^{i7π/5}, 4 e^{i9π/5}. So the product of all roots is (-1024). The product of all roots is (-1024). Therefore, the product of the non-real roots is (-1024)/(-4) = 256. So yes, same as before.

Therefore, the product of the non-real roots of z^5 = 1024 is 256, and similarly for z^5 = -1024 is also 256. Therefore, the total product of all possible z₁ is 256 * 256 = 65536.

But wait, is that correct? Let me check with specific numbers.

Take the product of the four roots from z^5 = 1024 (excluding 4): 4ω, 4ω², 4ω³, 4ω⁴. Their product is 4^4 * ω * ω² * ω³ * ω⁴ = 256 * ω^{10} = 256 * (ω^5)^2 = 256 * 1^2 = 256. Since ω^5 = e^{2πi} = 1.

Similarly, for the roots of z^5 = -1024, excluding -4: the roots are 4 e^{iπ/5}, 4 e^{i3π/5}, 4 e^{i7π/5}, 4 e^{i9π/5}. Let me denote η = e^{iπ/5}, then the roots are 4η, 4η³, 4η⁷, 4η⁹. But η^5 = e^{iπ} = -1. Let me compute their product:

4^4 * η * η³ * η⁷ * η⁹ = 256 * η^{1+3+7+9} = 256 * η^{20} = 256 * (η^5)^4 = 256 * (-1)^4 = 256 * 1 = 256. Correct.

Therefore, the total product is 256 * 256 = 65536. Which is 256 squared. But 256 is 2^8, so 256^2 = 2^16 = 65536.

But the problem says "the product of all possible values of z₁". However, wait—is there a possibility that some of these roots are duplicates? For example, is 4 e^{iπ/5} different from others? Yes, since angles π/5, 3π/5, 7π/5, 9π/5 are distinct and not overlapping with the other set. So total 8 distinct roots. Therefore, their product is 256 * 256 = 65536.

But let me check if there are any constraints that would reduce the number of possible z₁. For example, maybe z₂ is related to z₁ in some way that restricts the possible values of z₁?

Earlier, we found that |z₂| = 1/2 and z₂^5 is real. But z₂ is not real. So similar to z₁, z₂ can be any of the non-real 5th roots of ±(1/2)^5 = ±1/32. However, the problem doesn't give us any conditions on z₂ except that it's not real and satisfies the recurrence. However, since the problem asks for the product of all possible z₁, regardless of z₂, as long as there exists some z₂ that satisfies the conditions with that z₁. Therefore, even if multiple z₂ could correspond to a single z₁, as long as there exists at least one z₂ for each z₁, then all those z₁ are valid.

But is there a possibility that for some z₁, there is no suitable z₂? For example, suppose we fix z₁, then can we find a z₂ with |z₂|=1/2, z₂^5 real, and not real, such that the other conditions are satisfied?

But we already derived that |z₂| = 1/2 and z₂^5 is real. Therefore, as long as z₂ is chosen with those properties, then the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, for any z₁ with |z₁|=4 and z₁^5 real and not real, there exists such a z₂ (for example, take any z₂ with |z₂|=1/2, z₂^5 real and not real). Therefore, all such z₁ are allowed, hence the product is 65536.

But let me check if that answer makes sense. However, the problem says "the product of all possible values of z₁". But maybe there's a mistake here. Because when I considered z₁^5 = ±1024, but z₁^5 is real, but z₁^5 could be any real number, not necessarily ±1024. Wait, no. Wait, z₁^5 is real, but we also have |z₁| = 4. Therefore, |z₁^5| = |z₁|^5 = 4^5 = 1024. Therefore, z₁^5 is a real number with absolute value 1024, so z₁^5 = ±1024. Therefore, yes, z₁ must be a 5th root of 1024 or -1024. Therefore, the previous analysis holds.

Therefore, the product is 256 * 256 = 65536. However, let me check with an example.

Suppose we take z₁ = 4 e^{iπ/5} and z₂ = (1/2) e^{iπ/5}. Then z₂^5 = (1/2)^5 e^{iπ} = -1/32, which is real. Then check the modulus conditions:

|z₃/z₄| = 1/( |z₂|³ |z₁| ) = 1/( (1/2)^3 * 4 ) = 1/( (1/8)*4 ) = 1/(1/2) = 2. Correct.

Similarly |z₄/z₅| = 1/( |z₂|^7 |z₁|^3 ) = 1/( (1/2)^7 * 4^3 ) = 1/( 1/128 * 64 ) = 1/( 0.5 ) = 2. Correct.

Therefore, this z₁ is valid. Similarly for other roots. Therefore, all 8 roots are valid, and their product is 65536. However, the problem might expect a different answer. Wait, 65536 is 2^16, but maybe there's a simpler way to write it. However, let me check if there's a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, another way to compute the product of all possible z₁ is to consider that they are the roots of the equation z^5 = ±1024, excluding the real roots. The equation z^5 = 1024 has roots 4, 4ω, 4ω², 4ω³, 4ω⁴. Similarly, z^5 = -1024 has roots -4, -4ω, -4ω², -4ω³, -4ω⁴. But since we are excluding the real roots, which are 4 and -4, the product of all non-real roots is (product of z^5=1024 non-real) * (product of z^5=-1024 non-real) = 256 * 256 = 65536 as before.

But let me check if there's another way to think about this. Suppose we consider that for each z₁, there are multiple possibilities, but maybe they come in conjugate pairs or something, leading to the product being real or something else. However, since we have 8 roots, which is even, and they come in complex conjugate pairs, their product would be real and positive. Which matches 65536.

But let me check with specific numbers. Take z₁ = 4 e^{iπ/5} and its conjugate 4 e^{-iπ/5} = 4 e^{i9π/5}. Similarly, 4 e^{i3π/5} and 4 e^{-i3π/5} = 4 e^{i7π/5}. Then the product of these four would be [4 e^{iπ/5} * 4 e^{-iπ/5}] * [4 e^{i3π/5} * 4 e^{-i3π/5}] = (16) * (16) = 256. Similarly for the other four roots from z^5 = -1024: 4 e^{iπ/5} (wait, no, the roots from z^5=-1024 are different). Wait, no, the roots from z^5=-1024 are 4 e^{iπ/5}, 4 e^{i3π/5}, 4 e^{i7π/5}, 4 e^{i9π/5}? Wait no, earlier we said that for z^5=-1024, the non-real roots are 4 e^{iπ/5}, 4 e^{i3π/5}, 4 e^{i7π/5}, 4 e^{i9π/5}? Wait, no, earlier we said that for z^5=-1024, the roots are 4 e^{iπ/5}, 4 e^{i3π/5}, -4, 4 e^{i7π/5}, 4 e^{i9π/5}. So the non-real ones are the four mentioned. However, note that 4 e^{iπ/5} and 4 e^{i9π/5} are conjugates, as are 4 e^{i3π/5} and 4 e^{i7π/5}. Therefore, their product is [4 e^{iπ/5} * 4 e^{-iπ/5}] * [4 e^{i3π/5} * 4 e^{-i3π/5}] = 16 * 16 = 256. Therefore, the product of the four roots from z^5=-1024 is also 256. Therefore, total product is 256 * 256 = 65536.

But let me check if this is the answer expected. However, the problem says "the product of all possible values of z₁". However, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that all 8 roots are allowed. Let me check if there are any constraints between z₁ and z₂ that we haven't considered.

For example, suppose we take z₁ = 4 e^{iπ/5} and z₂ = (1/2) e^{iπ/5}. Then z₂^5 = (1/2)^5 e^{iπ} = -1/32, which is real. So that's okay. But what about other relations? For example, is there any condition that would link α and β?

Wait, let me think about the ratio z_{n+3}/z_n² being real. For example, take n=1: z₄/z₁² = z₂^5 is real. For n=2: z₅/z₂² = z₂^{10} z₁^{15} is real. Since z₂^5 is real, z₂^{10} is real, and z₁^5 is real, so z₁^{15} is real. Therefore, their product is real. But what if there's a condition that z_{n+3}/z_n² is not only real but also positive or something? No, the problem just says it's real. So negative real numbers are allowed.

But there's no further constraints. Therefore, the earlier reasoning seems correct.

However, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem that might lead to a different answer.

Let me consider that z₁^5 and z₂^5 are real numbers. Let me denote z₁^5 = a, z₂^5 = b, where a and b are real numbers. From earlier, we have |z₁| = 4, so |a| = |z₁^5| = 4^5 = 1024. Similarly, |z₂| = 1/2, so |b| = (1/2)^5 = 1/32.

Therefore, a = ±1024, b = ±1/32.

But since z₁ and z₂ are not real, their arguments are not multiples of π. However, this doesn't restrict the sign of a and b. For example, if z₁ is 4 e^{iπ/5}, then z₁^5 = 4^5 e^{iπ} = 1024 * (-1) = -1024. If z₁ is 4 e^{i2π/5}, then z₁^5 = 4^5 e^{i2π} = 1024 * 1 = 1024. Similarly for others.

Therefore, depending on the angle of z₁, z₁^5 can be ±1024. Similarly for z₂^5: if z₂ is (1/2) e^{iπ/5}, then z₂^5 = (1/2)^5 e^{iπ} = -1/32. If z₂ is (1/2) e^{i2π/5}, then z₂^5 = (1/2)^5 e^{i2π} = 1/32.

But in our earlier analysis, we considered that z₂ can be any non-real with |z₂|=1/2 and z₂^5 real, which would mean that z₂^5 is ±1/32. However, the problem doesn't specify any relation between z₁^5 and z₂^5. Therefore, they can be independently ±1024 and ±1/32.

But does this affect the possible values of z₁? No, because regardless of what z₂ is, as long as it satisfies its conditions, z₁ can be any of its possible values. Therefore, the product of all possible z₁ is still 65536.

But let me check if there's a mistake in the modulus calculation. Earlier, we had |z₁| = 4 and |z₂| = 1/2. But if z₁^5 is ±1024, then |z₁^5| = 1024, which matches |z₁|^5 = 4^5 = 1024. Similarly for z₂^5: |z₂^5| = (1/2)^5 = 1/32. So that's correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 65536, which is 2^16. But let me check if this is the case.

Wait, 4^4 * 4^4 = (4^4)^2 = 256^2 = 65536. Yes.

But let me check if there's an alternative interpretation of the problem. For example, maybe the product of all possible values of z₁ considering that for each z₁, there might be multiple z₂'s, but the problem says "the product of all possible values of z₁", which are the z₁'s that can be part of such a sequence. Since we've established that there are 8 such z₁'s, their product is 65536.

However, I'm a bit unsure because 65536 seems like a very large number, and math competition problems often have more elegant answers. Let me check if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, earlier I said that the product of the non-real roots of z^5 = 1024 is 256, and similarly for z^5 = -1024 is 256, so total product is 256 * 256 = 65536. But let me verify with Vieta's formula.

For the equation z^5 - 1024 = 0, the product of all roots is 1024. The real root is 4, so the product of the other four roots is 1024 / 4 = 256. Correct.

For the equation z^5 + 1024 = 0, the product of all roots is -1024. The real root is -4, so the product of the other four roots is (-1024)/(-4) = 256. Correct.

Therefore, the total product is 256 * 256 = 65536. Yes.

But let me think if there's another way this could be approached. For example, if we consider that the product of all possible z₁ is the product of the roots of the equation z^5 = ±1024 excluding the real roots. But since z^5 = ±1024 can be combined into a single equation: z^10 = (1024)^2 = 1048576, but excluding the real roots. However, the roots of z^10 = 1048576 are the 10th roots of 1048576, which includes both the 5th roots of 1024 and -1024. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, since the product of all non-real roots of z^5 = ±1024 is 256 * 256 = 65536, which is the answer.

But let me check with smaller numbers. Suppose instead of 4 and 1/2, we had |z₁|=1 and |z₂|=1, and similar conditions. Then the product would be... Well, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, think about the answer in terms of exponents. Since each z₁ is 4 times a 5th root of unity (but not real), and there are 8 such roots. The product of all 5th roots of unity (excluding 1 and -1) would be... Wait, the product of all 5th roots of unity is 1 (from Vieta). Excluding 1 and -1 (if applicable), but in our case, it's scaled by 4 and considering both ±1024.

But I think the previous calculation is correct. Therefore, I think the answer is 65536, which is 2^16.

But let me check if the problem says "product of all possible values of z₁", and if there are indeed 8 values, then 65536 is correct. However, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of 4^8 or something else. Let me calculate 4^8: 4^2=16, 4^4=256, 4^8=65536. Yes! 4^8 = (2^2)^8 = 2^16 = 65536. So the product is 4^8.

But why is that? Because each of the 8 roots is 4 times a root of unity (either e^{iπ/5}, e^{i3π/5}, etc.), and the product of those roots of unity would be... Let me think. If we take all the non-real 5th roots of ±1, then their product would be... Well, the product of all 5th roots of 1 is 1, excluding 1, the product is 1. Similarly for -1, but it's more complicated. However, in our case, the product of the roots is 4^8 times the product of the roots of unity. But since the product of the roots of unity is 1 (for the 5th roots of 1 excluding 1) multiplied by something for the other roots. Wait, this might not be straightforward.

But since we already calculated it as 4^8 = 65536, and that matches with the previous calculation, I think it's safe to go with that.

Therefore, the final answer is 65536, which is 4^8, and in boxed form, that would be \boxed{65536}.
</think>

To solve the given problem, we analyze the sequence of complex numbers $(z_n)$ defined by the recurrence relation:

$$
z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n, \quad \text{for all } n \geq 1,
$$
with the constraints:
- $z_1$ and $z_2$ are not real,
- $\dfrac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}$ is real for all $n \geq 1$,
- $\left|\dfrac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\dfrac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = 2$.

---

### Step 1: Expressing Terms Using the Recurrence

Using the recurrence relation, we compute:

- $z_3 = z_2^2 z_1$,
- $z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2$,
- $z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{12} z_1^5$.

---

### Step 2: Using the Given Modulus Conditions

We are given:

$$
\left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2.
$$

Compute:

- $\left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2} \right| = \frac{1}{|z_2|^3 |z_1|} = 2 \Rightarrow |z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2}$,
- $\left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^{12} z_1^5} \right| = \frac{1}{|z_2|^7 |z_1|^3} = 2 \Rightarrow |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2}$.

Let $a = |z_1|$, $b = |z_2|$. Then:

$$
b^3 a = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b^7 a^3 = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Dividing the second equation by the first:

$$
\frac{b^7 a^3}{b^3 a} = \frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1 \Rightarrow b^4 a^2 = 1.
$$

Substitute $a = \frac{1}{2 b^3}$ into this:

$$
b^4 \left( \frac{1}{2 b^3} \right)^2 = 1 \Rightarrow b^4 \cdot \frac{1}{4 b^6} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{4 b^2} = 1 \Rightarrow b^2 = \frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow b = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Then from $b^3 a = \frac{1}{2}$, we get:

$$
\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 a = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{8} a = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow a = 4.
$$

Thus, $|z_1| = 4$, $|z_2| = \frac{1}{2}$.

---

### Step 3: Argument Conditions

We are told that $z_1$ and $z_2$ are not real. Also, the ratio $\dfrac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}$ is real for all $n \geq 1$. This implies that the argument of $z_{n+3}$ must differ from twice the argument of $z_n$ by a multiple of $\pi$, i.e., the arguments must be such that the ratio is real.

By examining the recurrence, we find that the arguments of $z_1$ and $z_2$ must be such that $z_1^5$ and $z_2^5$ are real. This implies that the arguments of $z_1$ and $z_2$ are multiples of $\frac{\pi}{5}$, but not multiples of $\pi$, to ensure they are not real.

Let $z_1 = 4 e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta = \frac{k\pi}{5}$, $k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9$ (to avoid real values).

So the possible values of $z_1$ are:

$$
z_1 = 4 e^{i\pi/5}, \quad 4 e^{i2\pi/5}, \quad 4 e^{i3\pi/5}, \quad 4 e^{i4\pi/5}, \quad 4 e^{i6\pi/5}, \quad 4 e^{i7\pi/5}, \quad 4 e^{i8\pi/5}, \quad 4 e^{i9\pi/5}.
$$

These are the 8 non-real 5th roots of $1024$ and $-1024$ (since $z_1^5 = \pm 1024$).

---

### Step 4: Compute the Product of All Possible $z_1$

These 8 values of $z_1$ are the roots of the equations:

- $z^5 = 1024$ (excluding the real root $z = 4$),
- $z^5 = -1024$ (excluding the real root $z = -4$).

The product of all 5 roots of $z^5 = 1024$ is $1024$, so the product of the 4 non-real roots is:

$$
\frac{1024}{4} = 256.
$$

Similarly, the product of the 4 non-real roots of $z^5 = -1024$ is:

$$
\frac{-1024}{-4} = 256.
$$

Therefore, the total product of all 8 possible values of $z_1$ is:

$$
256 \times 256 = 65536.
$$

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 29. Extracted: {z} (if z ≠ 0). Wait, because 1/\overline{z} = z / |z|². Yes, because z * \overline{z} = |z|², so 1/\overline{z} = z / |z|².

Therefore, (17 -6i)z / |z|² = (17 -6i)/\overline{z}.

But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe consider combining the two equations into a complex equation.

Let me consider the original equations:

Equation 1: a + [Re(w)] / |z|² = 6,

Equation 2: b - [Im(w)] / |z|² = 0.

Let me write these as:

a + [Re(w)] / |z|² = 6,

b = [Im(w)] / |z|².

Now, if I think of a + ib as z, then:

z = a + ib = [6 - Re(w)/|z|²] + i [Im(w)/|z|²].

But Re(w) and Im(w) are related to w = (17 -6i)z. Let me substitute:

z = 6 - Re(w)/|z|² + i [Im(w)/|z|²].

But since w = (17 -6i)z, then Re(w) = 17a + 6b and Im(w) = -6a +17b, which are the numerators. But maybe I can write:

Let me write z = 6 - [Re(w)/|z|²] + i [Im(w)/|z|²].

But Re(w) = Re[(17 -6i)z], and Im(w) = Im[(17 -6i)z]. Let me denote that:

Let me write:

Let me consider that [Re(w) + i Im(w)] = w = (17 -6i)z. Therefore, Re(w) + i Im(w) = (17 -6i)z. Therefore, Re(w)/|z|² + i Im(w)/|z|² = (17 -6i)z / |z|².

But from the equations above, z = 6 - Re(w)/|z|² + i [Im(w)/|z|²]. Let me denote that:

z = 6 - [Re(w)/|z|²] + i [Im(w)/|z|²] = 6 - [Re(w)/|z|² - i Im(w)/|z|²] ?

Wait, no. Let me write:

z = 6 - [Re(w)/|z|²] + i [Im(w)/|z|²].

Let me rearrange terms:

z - 6 = - [Re(w)/|z|²] + i [Im(w)/|z|²].

But the right-hand side is -Re(w)/|z|² + i Im(w)/|z|² = - [Re(w) - i Im(w)] / |z|².

But Re(w) - i Im(w) is the conjugate of w? Wait, if w = Re(w) + i Im(w), then its conjugate is Re(w) - i Im(w). Therefore:

z - 6 = - \overline{w}/|z|².

But since w = (17 -6i)z, then \overline{w} = \overline{(17 -6i)z} = (17 + 6i)\overline{z}.

Therefore:

z - 6 = - (17 + 6i)\overline{z} / |z|².

But |z|² = z \overline{z}. Therefore, 1/|z|² = 1/(z \overline{z}).

So:

z - 6 = - (17 + 6i)\overline{z} / (z \overline{z}) ) = - (17 + 6i) / z.

Therefore:

z - 6 = - (17 + 6i)/z.

Multiply both sides by z:

z² - 6z = - (17 + 6i).

Rearranged:

z² - 6z + (17 + 6i) = 0.

So now we have a quadratic equation in z: z² - 6z + (17 + 6i) = 0.

Great! Now, solving this quadratic equation will give us the complex solutions z, from which we can get the real solutions (a, b). Let me solve this quadratic.

Using the quadratic formula:

z = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 4 * 1 * (17 + 6i))]/2.

Compute the discriminant D = 36 - 4*(17 + 6i) = 36 - 68 - 24i = -32 -24i.

So we need to compute sqrt(-32 -24i). Let me find a complex number w = x + yi such that w² = -32 -24i.

Let me set (x + yi)² = x² - y² + 2xyi = -32 -24i.

Therefore, we have the system:

x² - y² = -32,

2xy = -24.

From the second equation: xy = -12 => y = -12/x. Substitute into the first equation:

x² - (-12/x)² = -32 => x² - 144/x² = -32.

Multiply both sides by x²:

x⁴ - 144 = -32x² => x⁴ +32x² -144 = 0.

Let me set u = x²:

u² +32u -144 = 0.

Solve for u:

u = [-32 ± sqrt(32² + 4*144)] / 2 = [-32 ± sqrt(1024 + 576)] / 2 = [-32 ± sqrt(1600)] / 2 = [-32 ± 40]/2.

So two possibilities:

u = (-32 + 40)/2 = 8/2 = 4,

u = (-32 -40)/2 = -72/2 = -36.

Since u = x² ≥ 0, discard the negative solution. Thus u = 4 => x² = 4 => x = ±2.

Now, if x = 2, then from xy = -12 => y = -12/2 = -6.

If x = -2, then y = -12/(-2) = 6.

Therefore, the square roots of -32 -24i are 2 -6i and -2 +6i.

Therefore, sqrt(D) is either 2 -6i or -2 +6i.

Therefore, the solutions for z are:

z = [6 ± (2 -6i)] / 2 and [6 ± (-2 +6i)] / 2.

Wait, let me compute both possibilities.

First case: sqrt(D) = 2 -6i:

z = [6 + (2 -6i)] / 2 = (8 -6i)/2 = 4 -3i.

Second case: sqrt(D) = -2 +6i:

z = [6 + (-2 +6i)] / 2 = (4 +6i)/2 = 2 +3i.

Alternatively, if we take the other sign:

Wait, the quadratic formula is [6 ± sqrt(D)] / 2. So the two roots are:

z₁ = [6 + (2 -6i)] / 2 = 4 -3i,

z₂ = [6 - (2 -6i)] / 2 = [6 -2 +6i]/2 = (4 +6i)/2 = 2 +3i.

Similarly, if we had taken the other square root, -2 +6i, then:

z₁ = [6 + (-2 +6i)] / 2 = 4 +6i / 2 = 2 +3i,

z₂ = [6 - (-2 +6i)] / 2 = [6 +2 -6i]/2 = 8 -6i /2 = 4 -3i.

So the two solutions are z = 4 -3i and z = 2 +3i.

Therefore, the real solutions (a, b) are:

For z = 4 -3i: a = 4, b = -3.

For z = 2 +3i: a = 2, b = 3.

Wait, but the problem says "real solutions (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, b_n)". So there are two solutions here. Therefore, the sum a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 = (4 + (-3)) + (2 + 3) = (1) + (5) = 6.

Wait, but let me check if these solutions actually satisfy the original equations. Let me verify for z = 4 -3i, so a=4, b=-3.

Compute a² + b² = 16 + 9 = 25.

First equation: a + (17a +6b)/25 = 4 + [17*4 +6*(-3)]/25 = 4 + [68 -18]/25 = 4 + 50/25 = 4 + 2 = 6. Correct.

Second equation: b + (6a -17b)/25 = -3 + [6*4 -17*(-3)]/25 = -3 + [24 +51]/25 = -3 + 75/25 = -3 + 3 = 0. Correct.

Now check z = 2 +3i, a=2, b=3.

a² + b² = 4 + 9 = 13.

First equation: 2 + [17*2 +6*3]/13 = 2 + [34 + 18]/13 = 2 + 52/13 = 2 + 4 = 6. Correct.

Second equation: 3 + [6*2 -17*3]/13 = 3 + [12 -51]/13 = 3 + (-39)/13 = 3 - 3 = 0. Correct.

Great! So both solutions are valid. Therefore, there are two solutions: (4, -3) and (2, 3). Therefore, the sum a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 = 4 + (-3) + 2 + 3 = (4 -3) + (2 +3) = 1 + 5 = 6.

But wait, the problem says "Find a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 + ... + a_n + b_n." Since there are two solutions, the answer is 6. However, I need to make sure there are only two solutions. Since the quadratic equation in z had two solutions, and each corresponds to one (a, b), so n=2. Hence the answer is 6.

But let me check if there are more solutions. The quadratic equation in z had two roots, so two solutions. Hence, the total sum is 6.

Wait, but the problem says "real solutions", and we found two real solutions. So the answer is 6.

But let me check again the discriminant calculation. When I solved for sqrt(-32 -24i), I found 2 -6i and -2 +6i. Squaring 2 -6i gives 4 - 24i + 36i² = 4 -24i -36 = -32 -24i. Correct. Similarly, (-2 +6i)^2 = 4 -24i + 36i² = same thing. Correct. So that's right.

Therefore, the answer should be 6.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}
</think>

To solve the system of equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
a + \frac{17a + 6b}{a^2 + b^2} &= 6, \\
b + \frac{6a - 17b}{a^2 + b^2} &= 0,
\end{align*}
$$

we are guided to use **complex numbers**. Let us define a complex number $ z = a + bi $, where $ a, b \in \mathbb{R} $, and note that $ |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2 $. 

We observe that the expressions $ 17a + 6b $ and $ 6a - 17b $ resemble the real and imaginary parts of a complex number multiplied by $ z $. In particular, consider the complex number $ 17 - 6i $, and compute:

$$
(17 - 6i)z = (17 - 6i)(a + bi) = (17a + 6b) + i(-6a + 17b).
$$

This allows us to write the system in terms of $ z $:

$$
\begin{align*}
a + \frac{\text{Re}((17 - 6i)z)}{|z|^2} &= 6, \\
b - \frac{\text{Im}((17 - 6i)z)}{|z|^2} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

Let us define $ w = (17 - 6i)z $. Then:

$$
\begin{align*}
a + \frac{\text{Re}(w)}{|z|^2} &= 6, \\
b - \frac{\text{Im}(w)}{|z|^2} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

Now, observe that $ z = a + bi $, and we can combine the above equations into a single complex equation. Define:

$$
z = 6 - \frac{\text{Re}(w)}{|z|^2} + i \cdot \frac{\text{Im}(w)}{|z|^2}.
$$

But since $ w = (17 - 6i)z $, we can write:

$$
z = 6 - \frac{\text{Re}((17 - 6i)z)}{|z|^2} + i \cdot \frac{\text{Im}((17 - 6i)z)}{|z|^2}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
z = 6 - \frac{(17 - 6i)z}{|z|^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\overline{z}} \cdot z.
$$

After simplifying, we arrive at the equation:

$$
z^2 - 6z + (17 + 6i) = 0.
$$

This is a quadratic in $ z $, and we solve it using the quadratic formula:

$$
z = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4(17 + 6i)}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{-32 - 24i}}{2}.
$$

We now compute $ \sqrt{-32 - 24i} $. Let $ \sqrt{-32 - 24i} = x + yi $, so:

$$
(x + yi)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi = -32 - 24i.
$$

Matching real and imaginary parts:

$$
\begin{cases}
x^2 - y^2 = -32 \\
2xy = -24
\end{cases}
\Rightarrow
\begin{cases}
x^2 - y^2 = -32 \\
xy = -12
\end{cases}
$$

Solving this system yields $ x = \pm 2 $, $ y = \mp 6 $, so the square roots are $ \pm (2 - 6i) $.

Thus, the solutions for $ z $ are:

$$
z = \frac{6 \pm (2 - 6i)}{2} \Rightarrow z = 4 - 3i \quad \text{or} \quad z = 2 + 3i.
$$

These correspond to the real solutions $ (a, b) $:

- For $ z = 4 - 3i $: $ a = 4, b = -3 $
- For $ z = 2 + 3i $: $ a = 2, b = 3 $

Now, compute the required sum:

$$
a_1 + b_1 + a_2 + b_2 = (4 - 3) + (2 + 3) = 1 + 5 = \boxed{6}

To solve the given equation:

$$
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 = d + 36 \sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}
$$

we aim to find the value of $ a + b + c + d $.

---

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification

Let us define:
$$
x = 10a + 14b + 22c - d
$$
Then the original equation becomes:
$$
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 = d + 36\sqrt{x}
$$

We can now express $ d $ from the definition of $ x $:
$$
d = 10a + 14b + 22c - x
$$

Substituting this back into the equation:
$$
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 = 10a + 14b + 22c - x + 36\sqrt{x}
$$

Rearranging:
$$
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - 10a - 14b - 22c + x = 36\sqrt{x}
$$

---

### Step 2: Completing the Square

We now complete the square for the quadratic terms involving $ a, b, c $:

- $ a^2 - 10a = (a - 5)^2 - 25 $
- $ b^2 - 14b = (b - 7)^2 - 49 $
- $ c^2 - 22c = (c - 11)^2 - 121 $

So the equation becomes:
$$
(a - 5)^2 + (b - 7)^2 + (c - 11)^2 - 25 - 49 - 121 + 519 + x = 36\sqrt{x}
$$

Simplify constants:
$$
-25 - 49 - 121 + 519 = 324
$$

Thus:
$$
(a - 5)^2 + (b - 7)^2 + (c - 11)^2 + 324 + x = 36\sqrt{x}
$$

Let:
- $ u = a - 5 $
- $ v = b - 7 $
- $ w = c - 11 $

Then:
$$
u^2 + v^2 + w^2 + 324 + x = 36\sqrt{x}
$$

---

### Step 3: Introduce $ z = \sqrt{x} $

Let $ z = \sqrt{x} $, so $ x = z^2 $. The equation becomes:
$$
u^2 + v^2 + w^2 + 324 + z^2 = 36z
$$

Rearranging:
$$
u^2 + v^2 + w^2 + z^2 - 36z + 324 = 0
$$

Complete the square for $ z $:
$$
z^2 - 36z + 324 = (z - 18)^2
$$

So the equation becomes:
$$
u^2 + v^2 + w^2 + (z - 18)^2 = 0
$$

Since the sum of squares is zero, each term must be zero:
- $ u = 0 \Rightarrow a = 5 $
- $ v = 0 \Rightarrow b = 7 $
- $ w = 0 \Rightarrow c = 11 $
- $ z = 18 \Rightarrow \sqrt{x} = 18 \Rightarrow x = 324 $

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ d $

Recall:
$$
x = 10a + 14b + 22c - d
$$
Substitute $ a = 5, b = 7, c = 11 $:
$$
x = 10(5) + 14(7) + 22(11) - d = 50 + 98 + 242 - d = 390 - d
$$

But $ x = 324 $, so:
$$
390 - d = 324 \Rightarrow d = 66
$$

---

### Step 5: Final Answer

Now compute:
$$
a + b + c + d = 5 + 7 + 11 + 66 = \boxed{89}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 50. Extracted: {23, 29} (tens digit 2, units 3 or 9)

- One from {53, 59} (tens 5, units 3 or 9)
- One from {61, 67} (tens 6, units 1 or 7)

And the units digits across all four primes must be 1,3,7,9 exactly once.

So, let's think about possible combinations.

Let me consider the units digits. Let's note that 1,3,7,9 must each be used once. Let's check which primes can contribute to these units digits.

First, the units digits:

- 1: can be from 41 or 61.
- 3: can be from 23, 43, 53.
- 7: can be from 47, 67.
- 9: can be from 29, 59.

So, each of these units digits must be covered once.

Let me think of possible assignments.

Let me try to find combinations where each of the units digits is covered once.

Let me consider possible options for 9. Since 9 can be from 29 or 59.

Case 1: 9 is from 29. Then, the prime 29 is used. That uses units digit 9 and tens digit 2. Then, for the tens digit 2, we can't use 23 anymore. So, the 29 is selected, so the units digit 9 is used. Then, the other primes need to cover 1,3,7.

Now, for the other primes:

- Tens digit 4: can be 41, 43, 47.
- Tens digit 5: can be 53 or 59 (but 59 is already used? No, in this case, we have 29, so 59 is still available. Wait, no, if we have 29, then the units digit 9 is used, so 59 can't be used because that would use 9 again. So in this case, since we already used 9 in 29, the 59 is not allowed. Therefore, for the tens digit 5, we can only use 53. Because 59 would use 9 again.

So, if we take 29 (units 9), then for tens digit 5, we have to take 53 (units 3). Then, units digits used so far: 9 and 3. Remaining units digits: 1 and 7.

Now, for tens digit 4, we need to choose between 41, 43, 47. But 3 is already used (from 53), so 43 can't be used. So, options are 41 or 47. Let's consider:

If we take 41 (units 1), then units digits used are 9,3,1. Remaining is 7. Then, for tens digit 6, the primes are 61 or 67. But 1 is already used (from 41), so 61 is not allowed. So we have to take 67 (units 7). That works. Then the primes would be 29, 53, 41, 67. Let's check digits:

Digits used:

29: 2 and 9.

53: 5 and 3.

41: 4 and 1.

67: 6 and 7.

All digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9 are used once. Perfect! So that's a valid combination. The primes would be 29, 53, 41, 67. Their sum is 29 + 53 + 41 + 67. Let me calculate that: 29 + 53 is 82, 41 + 67 is 108. Total sum is 82 + 108 = 190.

Alternatively, let's check if there are other possibilities in this case. Suppose in the tens digit 4, we take 47 (units 7). Then, units digits used would be 9 (from 29), 3 (from 53), and 7 (from 47). Remaining unit digit is 1. Then, for tens digit 6, we need to take a prime with units digit 1. The options are 61. But 61 uses 6 and 1. So that's allowed. Then the primes would be 29, 53, 47, 61. Let's check digits:

29: 2,9

53:5,3

47:4,7

61:6,1

All digits are used once. So that's another valid combination. The sum here is 29 + 53 + 47 + 61. Let's calculate: 29 + 53 = 82, 47 + 61 = 108. Total is 82 + 108 = 190. Same sum.

So both combinations give sum 190.

Now, let's check if there are other cases.

Case 2: 9 is from 59. So, the prime 59 is used. That uses units digit 9 and tens digit 5. Then, for the tens digit 5, we can't use 53 anymore. So, the primes for tens digit 5 is 59. Now, for the other primes:

- Tens digit 2: can be 23 or 29. But 29 uses 9, which is already used here (since 59 uses 9). Therefore, 29 is not allowed. So, for tens digit 2, we have to use 23 (units 3).

So, prime 23 is selected. Now, units digits used are 9 (from 59) and 3 (from 23). Remaining units digits are 1 and 7.

Now, for tens digit 4, possible primes are 41, 43, 47. But 3 is already used (from 23), so 43 is out. So options are 41 or 47.

If we take 41 (units 1), then remaining unit digit is 7. Then, for tens digit 6, we need a prime with units 7. The options are 67. So primes would be 59, 23, 41, 67. Let's check digits:

59: 5,9

23:2,3

41:4,1

67:6,7

All digits used once. Sum is 59 + 23 + 41 + 67. Let's calculate: 59 + 23 = 82, 41 + 67 = 108. Total 190 again.

Alternatively, if we take 47 (units 7) for tens digit 4, then remaining unit digit is 1. Then, for tens digit 6, we need a prime with units 1, which is 61. So primes are 59, 23, 47, 61. Check digits:

59:5,9

23:2,3

47:4,7

61:6,1

All digits used once. Sum is 59 + 23 + 47 + 61. Let's compute: 59 + 23 = 82, 47 + 61 = 108. Total 190 again.

So regardless of the combination, the sum is 190. So that seems to be the answer. But let's check if there are other possibilities where maybe the units digits are arranged differently.

Wait, are there other cases? For example, what if we have different assignments for the units digits?

Wait, in the above cases, we considered 9 being in 29 or 59. Are there other possibilities? Let me think.

Wait, the units digits must be 1,3,7,9. So, for example, could there be a case where 1 is used in a different way? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe there are other combinations where some primes are different. Let's think.

Suppose, for example, that the prime with tens digit 4 is 43. Let's see if that's possible.

Let me try another approach. Let's think of possible assignments for the units digits.

We need to assign 1,3,7,9 to the four primes. Let's think of possible assignments.

Each of the four primes has a unique units digit. Let's think of possible combinations.

For example, suppose the units digits are 1,3,7,9 assigned to the primes as follows:

- 1: from 41 or 61
- 3: from 23, 43, 53
- 7: from 47, 67
- 9: from 29, 59

So, let's consider different possibilities for the units digits.

Another approach: since the sum seems to always be 190 in the cases we checked, but let's see if there are other combinations.

For example, what if we use 43 as one of the primes?

Let me try that. Suppose we have 43 as a prime (tens 4, units 3). Then, units digit 3 is used. Then, for the other primes:

- The units digits left are 1,7,9.

For the tens digit 2, we can have 23 or 29. But 23 uses units 3, which is already used (since we have 43). Therefore, 23 can't be used. So for tens digit 2, we have to use 29 (units 9). Then, units 9 is used. Now, remaining units digits are 1 and 7.

For tens digit 5, possible primes are 53 (units 3, already used) or 59 (units 9, already used). So both are used. Therefore, no primes available for tens digit 5. That's a problem. Therefore, this combination is invalid. Therefore, if we use 43, then we can't get a valid combination. Hence, this path is invalid.

Another possibility: Let's try using 53 as a prime. So, 53 uses units 3. Then, for tens digit 2, we can use 23 or 29. If we use 23, then units 3 is already used (from 53), so that's not allowed. Therefore, tens digit 2 must use 29 (units 9). Then, units digits used are 3 (from 53) and 9 (from 29). Remaining units digits are 1 and 7.

For tens digit 4, we can choose between 41, 43 (but 3 is used), 47. So, 41 or 47. If we take 41 (units 1), then remaining is 7. For tens digit 6, take 67. That gives primes 53, 29, 41, 67. Which is the same as before. Sum 190.

Alternatively, if we take 47 (units 7), then remaining unit is 1. For tens digit 6, take 61. Which is the same as before. So again sum 190.

Another case: Let's try using 67 as a prime. Suppose we have 67 (units 7). Then, for the other primes:

Units digits left: 1,3,9.

For tens digit 2: 23 or 29. Let's say we take 23 (units 3). Then units digits used are 3 and 7. Remaining are 1 and 9.

For tens digit 4: possible primes are 41, 43 (but 3 is used), 47 (7 is used). So only 41. Take 41 (units 1). Then remaining unit is 9. For tens digit 5: 59 (units 9). So primes are 23, 41, 67, 59. Which is same as before. Sum 190.

Alternatively, if for tens digit 2, we take 29 (units 9). Then units digits used are 9 and 7. Remaining are 1 and 3. For tens digit 4: can take 41 or 43. If take 41 (units 1), then remaining is 3. For tens digit 5: 53. So primes are 29, 41, 67, 53. Again same as before. Sum 190.

Another case: Let's try using 47 as a prime. Suppose 47 is used (units 7). Then, for the other primes:

Units digits left: 1,3,9.

Tens digit 2: 23 or 29. Let's say 23 (units 3). Then units digits used are 3 and 7. Remaining 1 and 9. Tens digit 4: can take 41 (units 1), then tens digit 5: 59 (units 9). So primes 23, 41, 47, 59. Sum 23+41+47+59 = 170? Wait, 23+41 is 64, 47+59 is 106. Total 64+106=170? Wait, but earlier we had 190. Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, no, wait, in this case, the primes would be 23, 41, 47, 59. Let me check digits:

23: 2,3

41:4,1

47:4,7? Wait, no, 47 uses 4 and 7. But wait, the tens digit 4 is already used in 41. Wait, no, each digit can be used only once. Wait, if we have 41 (tens 4, units 1), and 47 (tens 4, units 7), that would use the digit 4 twice. Which is not allowed. Oh! That's a mistake here. Because if we have 41 and 47, both have tens digit 4. Which is not allowed. So this combination is invalid. Therefore, this case is impossible. So my mistake here. Therefore, when I considered tens digit 4, if I have already used 4 in 41, I can't use 4 again in 47. Therefore, this case is invalid. Hence, that combination is not possible.

Therefore, when I have 47 as a prime, and 41 as another, that would conflict. So, in this case, if I have 47 (tens 4, units 7), then for tens digit 4, we can't use 41. So, if we have 47, then for the other primes with tens digit 4, we can't have 41. So, let me correct that.

So, if I have 47 (units 7), then for the other primes:

Units digits left: 1,3,9.

Tens digit 2: 23 or 29. Let's say 23 (units 3). Then, units digits used are 3 and 7. Remaining are 1 and 9.

For tens digit 4, we can't use 41 or 43 (since 3 is used). Wait, 43 would use units 3, which is already used. But 41 uses units 1. But if we have already used 4 in 47, then we can't use 4 again. Wait, no, the tens digit for 47 is 4, so if we have 47, then the digit 4 is already used. Therefore, for tens digit 4, we can't have another prime. Therefore, if we have 47, then the tens digit 4 is already used, so we can't have any other prime with tens digit 4. Therefore, in this scenario, if we have 47 (tens 4), then the other primes with tens digits 2,5,6.

Wait, let me re-express this. If we have 47 (tens 4, units 7), then the digit 4 is used. So, for the other primes, the tens digits available are 2,5,6 (since 4 is already used). Wait, no, the tens digits are 2,4,5,6. If we have used 4 in 47, then the remaining tens digits are 2,5,6. So, for the other primes, we need to have one prime with tens digit 2, one with 5, one with 6.

But the units digits are 1,3,9. Let me think.

So, with 47 (units 7), then units digits left are 1,3,9. Let's say we have:

- Tens digit 2: can be 23 or 29. Let's take 23 (units 3). Then units digits used are 3 and 7. Remaining are 1 and 9.

Then, for tens digit 5: can be 53 (units 3, already used) or 59 (units 9). So take 59 (units 9). Now, units digits used are 3,7,9. Remaining is 1.

For tens digit 6: need a prime with units 1. That is 61. So primes are 47, 23, 59, 61. Let's check digits:

47: 4,7

23: 2,3

59:5,9

61:6,1

All digits used once. So that's valid. The sum is 47 + 23 + 59 + 61. Let's calculate:

47 + 23 = 70; 59 + 61 = 120. Total 70 + 120 = 190. Again, same sum.

So even in this case, the sum is 190.

Another possibility: if in the same scenario, we take 29 instead of 23. So, with 47 (units 7), tens digit 2 is 29 (units 9). Then units digits used are 7 and 9. Remaining are 1 and 3.

For tens digit 5: can be 53 (units 3) or 59 (units 9, already used). So take 53 (units 3). Now, units digits used are 7,9,3. Remaining is 1.

For tens digit 6: take 61. So primes are 47, 29, 53, 61. Check digits:

47:4,7

29:2,9

53:5,3

61:6,1

All digits used once. Sum is 47 + 29 + 53 + 61 = 47 + 29 = 76; 53 + 61 = 114. Total 76 + 114 = 190. Same sum again.

So regardless of the combination, the sum is always 190. Therefore, the answer is 190.

Let me check if there are other possible combinations. For example, using 67 and 43. Wait, earlier when I tried using 43, it led to a problem. Let me try again.

Suppose we have 43 (tens 4, units 3). Then, units digit 3 is used. For tens digit 2, we can't use 23 (because units 3 is used), so must use 29 (units 9). Then units digits used are 3 and 9. Remaining are 1 and 7.

For tens digit 5: can be 53 (units 3, already used) or 59 (units 9, already used). So no options. Hence, invalid.

Another case: suppose we use 61 (units 1) and 67 (units 7). Let's see if that can be part of a combination.

If we have 61 (tens 6, units 1) and 67 (tens 6, units 7). But wait, you can't have two primes with the same tens digit. Because each digit is used once. So if we have 61, then the digit 6 is used, so we can't have 67. Hence, only one of them can be used.

So, for example, if we take 61 (units 1), then for tens digit 6, we can't take 67. So, if we have 61, then the other primes must use tens digits 2,4,5.

Let me try that. Suppose 61 is used (units 1). Then, units digits left are 3,7,9.

For tens digit 2: can be 23 or 29.

Let's take 23 (units 3). Then units digits used are 1,3. Remaining are 7 and 9.

For tens digit 4: possible primes are 47 (units 7) or 49 (invalid). So 47. Then units digits used are 1,3,7. Remaining is 9.

For tens digit 5: 59 (units 9). So primes are 61, 23, 47, 59. Which we've seen before. Sum 190.

Alternatively, if for tens digit 2, we take 29 (units 9). Then units digits used are 1 and 9. Remaining are 3 and 7.

For tens digit 4: can be 43 (units 3) or 47 (units 7). Let's take 43 (units 3). Then remaining is 7. For tens digit 5: 57 (invalid) or 53 (units 3, already used). Wait, 53 is units 3, which is already used. So no option. Hence invalid. Alternatively, if we take 47 (units 7), then remaining is 3. For tens digit 5: 53 (units 3). So primes are 61, 29, 47, 53. Which is valid. Check digits:

61:6,1

29:2,9

47:4,7

53:5,3

All digits used once. Sum is 61 + 29 + 47 + 53 = same as before, 190.

So again, same sum.

Another case: Let's try using 41 and 67. Suppose we have 41 (units 1) and 67 (units 7). Then, units digits used are 1 and 7. Remaining are 3 and 9.

For tens digit 2: can be 23 or 29. Let's say 23 (units 3). Then units digits used are 1,7,3. Remaining is 9. For tens digit 5: 59 (units 9). So primes are 41, 67, 23, 59. Sum 190.

Alternatively, if tens digit 2 is 29 (units 9), then units digits used are 1,7,9. Remaining is 3. For tens digit 5: 53. So primes are 41, 67, 29, 53. Sum 190.

So again, same sum.

Is there any other combination where the sum might be different? Let me think. Suppose we use 23, 59, 47, 61. Wait, that's the same as before. All combinations seem to lead to the same sum.

Alternatively, what if we use 29, 43, 59... Wait, no, because 29 and 59 both use 9. That's invalid.

Another possibility: using 53 and 29. Wait, that's already considered.

Another check: Are there any other primes that I might have missed?

Wait, the tens digits are 2,4,5,6. For each of these, we considered the possible primes. For example, for tens digit 4, we have 41,43,47. For tens digit 5, 53,59. For tens digit 6, 61,67. For tens digit 2, 23,29. I think that's all.

Therefore, all possible combinations must use these primes, and in all cases, the sum is 190. Therefore, the answer is 190.

{"reasoning": "To solve the problem, we need to form four two-digit prime numbers using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, with each digit used exactly once.

To solve the problem, we are given the matrix equation:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}
$$

Let us denote the matrix $ M = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} $. Then, the square of this matrix is:

$$
M^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Equating this with the given matrix on the right-hand side:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}
$$

This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $ a^2 + bc = c $
2. $ ab + bd = a $
3. $ ac + dc = d $
4. $ bc + d^2 = b $

---

### Step 1: Factor and simplify equations

From equations (2) and (3), we can factor out $ b $ and $ c $, respectively:

- Equation (2): $ b(a + d) = a $
- Equation (3): $ c(a + d) = d $

Let us define $ S = a + d $. Then, the equations become:

- $ bS = a $
- $ cS = d $

If $ S \neq 0 $, we can solve for $ b $ and $ c $:

$$
b = \frac{a}{S}, \quad c = \frac{d}{S}
$$

We now substitute these into equations (1) and (4):

- Equation (1): $ a^2 + bc = c \Rightarrow a^2 + \frac{a}{S} \cdot \frac{d}{S} = \frac{d}{S} $
- Equation (4): $ bc + d^2 = b \Rightarrow \frac{a}{S} \cdot \frac{d}{S} + d^2 = \frac{a}{S} $

Multiplying both equations by $ S^2 $ to eliminate denominators and simplifying, we eventually find that **either** $ a = d $ **or** a contradiction arises (which is only possible if $ S = 0 $).

---

### Case 1: $ S = a + d \neq 0 $

From earlier, we have:

- $ b = \frac{a}{S}, \quad c = \frac{d}{S} $

Substituting into equation (1):

$$
a^2 + \frac{a d}{S^2} = \frac{d}{S}
$$

Multiplying through by $ S^2 $, and using $ S = a + d $, we eventually derive that $ a = d $.

Thus, $ S = 2a \Rightarrow b = \frac{a}{2a} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad c = \frac{a}{2a} = \frac{1}{2} $

Substituting into equation (1):

$$
a^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow a^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow a^2 = \frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow a = \pm \frac{1}{2}
$$

So we get two solutions:

- $ (a, b, c, d) = \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) $
- $ (a, b, c, d) = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) $

---

### Case 2: $ S = a + d = 0 \Rightarrow d = -a $

Then equations (2) and (3) become:

- $ b \cdot 0 = a \Rightarrow a = 0 $
- $ c \cdot 0 = d \Rightarrow d = 0 $

So $ a = d = 0 $, and the equations reduce to:

- $ bc = c $
- $ bc = b $

From these, we get:

- $ c(b - 1) = 0 $
- $ b(c - 1) = 0 $

</think>

To solve the problem, we are given the equations:

- $ z^{13} = w $
- $ w^{11} = z $

We are also told that the **imaginary part of $ z $** is $ \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right) $, where $ m $ and $ n $ are relatively prime positive integers with $ m < n $. We are to find the value of $ n $.

---

### Step 1: Combine the Equations

From the first equation, $ w = z^{13} $. Substituting into the second equation:

$$
w^{11} = (z^{13})^{11} = z^{143} = z
$$

So:

$$
z^{143} = z \Rightarrow z^{142} = 1
$$

This tells us that **$ z $ is a 142nd root of unity**. That is, $ z = e^{2\pi i k / 142} = e^{\pi i k / 71} $, for some integer $ k \in \{0, 1, \dots, 141\} $.

---

### Step 2: Express the Imaginary Part of $ z $

The imaginary part of a complex number $ z = e^{i\theta} $ is $ \sin(\theta) $. So for $ z = e^{\pi i k / 71} $, the imaginary part is:

$$
\text{Im}(z) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi k}{71}\right)
$$

We are told that this is equal to $ \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right) $. So we have:

$$
\sin\left(\frac{\pi k}{71}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right)
$$

This implies that:

$$
\frac{\pi k}{71} = \frac{m\pi}{n} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\pi k}{71} = \pi - \frac{m\pi}{n}
$$

Dividing both sides by $ \pi $, we get:

- Case 1: $ \frac{k}{71} = \frac{m}{n} $
- Case 2: $ \frac{k}{71} = 1 - \frac{m}{n} $

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Cases

#### Case 1: $ \frac{k}{71} = \frac{m}{n} $

This implies:

$$
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{k}{71}
$$

Since $ m $ and $ n $ are relatively prime, and $ k \in \{1, 2, \dots, 70\} $ (we exclude $ k = 0 $ since that would make $ \sin(0) = 0 $, which is not in the form $ \sin(m\pi/n) $ with $ m > 0 $), and 71 is prime, then $ \gcd(k, 71) = 1 $ for all $ k < 71 $.

So, $ \frac{k}{71} $ is in lowest terms, and thus $ n = 71 $.

#### Case 2: $ \frac{k}{71} = 1 - \frac{m}{n} $

Then:

$$
\frac{m}{n} = 1 - \frac{k}{71} = \frac{71 - k}{71}
$$

Again, since $ k \in \{1, 2, \dots, 70\} $, $ 71 - k \in \{1, 2, \dots, 70\} $, and again, $ \gcd(71 - k, 71) = 1 $, so $ \frac{71 - k}{71} $ is in lowest terms, and again $ n = 71 $.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

In both cases, the denominator $ n $ is always **71**, and since 71 is prime, and $ m < n $, the pair $ (m, n) $ is always in lowest terms.

Hence, the value of $ n $ is:

$$

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 70. Extracted: {n+1}, where S_n is the sum of the first n powers of 2. For example, S_3 is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. 

First, I need to figure out what S_n actually is. Since it's the sum of the first n powers of 2 starting from 2^0. Wait, the sum of a geometric series. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Here, a is 1 (since 2^0 = 1), r is 2, and the number of terms is n. So S_n should be (2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^n - 1. Let me check with the example given: S_3 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. Yep, that matches. So S_n = 2^n - 1.

Therefore, S_{n} = 2^n - 1 and S_{n+1} = 2^{n+1} - 1. The problem asks for the largest possible value of GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}).

So, we need to compute GCD(2^n - 1, 2^{n+1} - 1). Let me recall that GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, b - a) when a < b. Let me apply that here. Let me denote a = 2^n - 1 and b = 2^{n+1} - 1. Then, GCD(a, b) = GCD(2^n - 1, (2^{n+1} - 1) - (2^n - 1)) = GCD(2^n - 1, 2^{n+1} - 1 - 2^n + 1) = GCD(2^n - 1, 2^{n+1} - 2^n). 

Simplify the second term: 2^{n+1} - 2^n = 2^n*(2 - 1) = 2^n*1 = 2^n. So now we have GCD(2^n - 1, 2^n). 

But 2^n and 2^n - 1 are consecutive integers. Because 2^n - 1 and 2^n differ by 1. Therefore, their GCD must be 1. Because consecutive integers are coprime. So GCD(2^n - 1, 2^n) = 1. Therefore, GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}) = 1 for any n?

Wait, but the problem says "Find the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor..." So according to this, it's always 1? But that seems strange. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check with small n. Let's take n=1. S_1 = 2^0 = 1. S_2 = 2^0 + 2^1 = 1 + 2 = 3. GCD(1,3)=1. For n=2, S_2=3, S_3=7. GCD(3,7)=1. For n=3, S_3=7, S_4=15. GCD(7,15)=1. n=4: S_4=15, S_5=31. GCD(15,31)=1. Hmm, seems like all of them are 1. So then the answer is 1?

But the problem says "the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor". If it's always 1, then the answer is 1. But maybe I made a mistake in the formula for S_n?

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the first n powers of 2". Let me check again. For example, S_3 is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Which is 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. So the formula seems correct. Then S_n is indeed 2^n - 1. Therefore, S_{n} and S_{n+1} are 2^n -1 and 2^{n+1} -1. Then their GCD is 1. 

But maybe there's a case where they are not coprime? Let me think. Suppose there is a common divisor d > 1. Then d divides both 2^n -1 and 2^{n+1} -1. Then, d divides (2^{n+1} -1) - 2*(2^n -1) = 2^{n+1} -1 - 2^{n+1} + 2 = 1. Therefore, d divides 1. Therefore, the GCD is 1. So that's a proof that GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}) = 1 for all n. Therefore, the largest possible value is 1. 

But the problem says "Find the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms... for any n." So maybe the answer is 1? But why does the problem ask for the largest possible value if it's always 1? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not about S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k, but sum_{k=1}^n 2^k? Let me check the example again. The problem says S_3 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 7. So that's from k=0 to 2, which is 3 terms. So S_n is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k. Which is 2^n - 1. So that seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem defines S_n as sum_{k=1}^n 2^k, which would be 2^{n+1} - 2. But in that case, the example would be S_3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, which is not 7. So the original problem's example shows that S_3 is 7, which is 2^3 - 1. So the formula S_n = 2^n -1 is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering S_n as sum_{k=0}^n 2^k, which would be 2^{n+1} - 1. Then S_3 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15. But the problem says S_3 is 7. Therefore, the original definition is sum from 0 to n-1. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}) is always 1. Therefore, the largest possible value is 1. But maybe the problem is different. Wait, perhaps the problem is not about S_n being sum of powers of 2, but sum of first n powers of 2, meaning 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n? Let me check again. 

The problem says "the sum of the first n powers of 2". The first power of 2 is 2^1 = 2, but in the example, S_3 is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2. So that includes 2^0. So maybe the problem counts 2^0 as the first power? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but given the example, we have to go with that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines S_n as the sum of the first n terms of the sequence 2^0, 2^1, 2^2,... So S_1 = 2^0 = 1, S_2 = 1 + 2 = 3, S_3 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, etc. So that's the same as before. 

Therefore, regardless, the formula S_n = 2^n -1 holds. Therefore, GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}) = 1. 

But maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again. Suppose d divides both 2^n - 1 and 2^{n+1} - 1. Then, as before, d divides (2^{n+1} -1) - 2*(2^n -1) = 2^{n+1} -1 - 2^{n+1} + 2 = 1. Therefore, d divides 1, so d=1. Therefore, the GCD is indeed 1. 

Therefore, the answer is 1. But why does the problem ask for the largest possible value? Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is not about consecutive terms S_n and S_{n+1}, but about consecutive terms in the sequence of S_n? But that's what I considered. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^k, but something else. Let me check again. 

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the first n powers of 2". If "powers of 2" refers to exponents, then the first power is 2^1, second is 2^2, etc. But then S_3 would be 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, which contradicts the example. However, the example says S_3 = 7, which is 1 + 2 + 4. So that's 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2. Therefore, the problem is considering the first n terms starting from 2^0. So the first power is 2^0? That's a bit non-standard, but given the example, that's how it is. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using "powers of 2" to mean the numbers 2, 4, 8, etc., and the first power is 2^1. But in that case, the example is wrong. Since the example says S_3 is 7, which is 1 + 2 + 4. Therefore, the problem must be including 2^0 as the first term. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the GCD is always 1. Hence, the answer is 1. 

But maybe the problem is in another interpretation. For example, if S_n is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence 2^1, 2^2, ..., then S_n = 2^{n+1} - 2. Then S_n = 2(2^n - 1). Then S_{n} and S_{n+1} would be 2(2^n -1) and 2(2^{n+1} - 1). Then GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}) = 2 * GCD(2^n -1, 2^{n+1} -1) = 2*1=2. So in this case, the GCD would be 2. But this contradicts the example given in the problem. 

But the problem's example says S_3 is 7, which would not be the case if S_n is sum from 2^1 to 2^n. Therefore, the original interpretation is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to compute S_n. Let me check again. 

The problem says "the sum of the first n powers of 2". If "powers of 2" are considered as exponents, then the first power is 2^1, second is 2^2, etc. But the example contradicts that. Therefore, the problem must be considering 2^0 as the first power. Maybe the problem uses "powers of 2" to mean the numbers generated by 2^k, starting from k=0. 

In any case, given the example, S_3 = 7 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2, which is sum from k=0 to 2. So for general n, S_n is sum from k=0 to n-1 of 2^k = 2^n - 1. Therefore, the GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}) is 1. 

Therefore, the answer is 1. But the problem says "the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor... for any n". So maybe the answer is 1. 

But maybe there's a case where n is zero? Let me check. If n=0, then S_0 would be the sum of the first 0 powers of 2, which is 0. Then S_0 = 0, S_1 = 1. GCD(0,1) is 1. Still 1. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me think again. Suppose d divides both 2^n -1 and 2^{n+1} -1. Then, since d divides 2^n -1, then 2^n ≡ 1 mod d. Then 2^{n+1} = 2*2^n ≡ 2*1 = 2 mod d. But 2^{n+1} ≡ 1 mod d (since d divides 2^{n+1} -1). Therefore, 2 ≡ 1 mod d, which implies d divides 1. Hence, d=1. Therefore, the GCD is indeed 1. 

Therefore, regardless of n, the GCD is 1. Hence, the largest possible value is 1. 

But why does the problem ask this then? Maybe there's a trick here. Wait, maybe the problem is not about S_n and S_{n+1}, but about two consecutive terms in the sequence S_1, S_2, S_3,... but that's what I considered. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the sum of the first n powers of 2, meaning 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n, which would be 2^{n+1} - 2. Then S_n = 2^{n+1} - 2. Then S_{n} = 2(2^n - 1). Then S_{n+1} = 2(2^{n+1} - 1). Then GCD(S_n, S_{n+1}) = 2 * GCD(2^n -1, 2^{n+1} -1) = 2*1 = 2. So in this case, the GCD is 2. But then the example given in the problem would be S_3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, which is not 7. So the problem's example contradicts this. 

Therefore, the original interpretation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 1. 

But maybe the problem is in another language, and "powers of 2" is translated differently. But given the example, we have to go with the initial analysis. 

So I think the answer is 1. Therefore, the largest possible value is 1.

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 77. Extracted: {i=1}^4 (S - 2x_i)^2, where S is the sum of all variables, and x_i is each variable in turn. Wait, no, because S would be a + b + c + d. If I take (-a + b + c + d) = S - 2a. Similarly for others. So each term is (S - 2x_i)^2, where x_i is a, b, c, d in turn.

Then, the sum would be sum_{i=1}^4 (S - 2x_i)^2.

Expanding this, each term is S² -4S x_i +4x_i². So the total sum is 4S² -4S*(a + b + c + d) + 4*(a² + b² + c² + d²).

But since S = a + b + c + d, then:

Total sum = 4S² -4S*S +4*(a² + b² + c² + d²) = 4S² -4S² +4*(sum of squares) = 4*(sum of squares).

Which matches the previous conclusion. Therefore, the cross terms indeed cancel out, and the total is 4*(a² + b² + c² + d²).

Therefore, in our problem, since a = √3, b = √5, c = √6, d = √7, then:

sum of squares is 4*( (√3)^2 + (√5)^2 + (√6)^2 + (√7)^2 ) = 4*(3 +5 +6 +7) = 4*(21) = 84.

Wait, 3 +5 is 8, 8 +6 is 14, 14 +7 is 21. Yes. 4*21=84.

But wait, that seems straightforward. But let me check again with the earlier expansion. Because if that's the case, then the answer is 84. But let me verify with a small example. Suppose I take simpler numbers. Let me take a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1. Then each term would be (-1 +1 +1 +1)^2 = (2)^2=4, same for all four terms. So total sum is 4*4=16. According to the formula, 4*(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 +1^2)=4*(4)=16. Correct. So the formula seems to hold.

Another test case: Let a=1, b=0, c=0, d=0. Then the four terms would be (-1 +0+0+0)^2=1, (1 -0+0+0)^2=1, (1 +0 -0 +0)^2=1, (1 +0 +0 -0)^2=1. Sum is 4. According to formula: 4*(1^2 +0 +0 +0)=4*1=4. Correct. So seems correct.

Therefore, applying this formula to the original problem, the answer is 4*(3 +5 +6 +7) = 4*21=84. Therefore, the answer is 84.

Wait, but let me check again. Because the original problem is:

[(-√3 + √5 + √6 + √7)^2 + ... ] which is exactly the case where each term is S - 2x_i, where S is √3 + √5 + √6 + √7, and x_i is each of the four terms. Therefore, the formula applies. Therefore, the answer is 4*(sum of squares of each term). Which is 4*(3 +5 +6 +7) = 4*21=84.

But wait, the original problem is adding four terms, each squared, which according to the formula is 4*(sum of squares). So yes, that would be 4*(3 +5 +6 +7) = 84. Therefore, the answer is 84.

But let me check with another approach. Let me compute each term's square and add them up, but maybe that's too tedious. Alternatively, take a simpler case where variables are numbers. Let me take a=√3, b=√5, c=√6, d=√7. Then according to the formula, the answer is 84. Let me see if that makes sense.

Alternatively, think of expanding one term. Let's take Term1 squared:

(-√3 + √5 + √6 + √7)^2. Let me compute that:

= (√5 + √6 + √7 - √3)^2

= (√5)^2 + (√6)^2 + (√7)^2 + (-√3)^2 + 2*(√5*√6 + √5*√7 + √5*(-√3) + √6*√7 + √6*(-√3) + √7*(-√3))

= 5 + 6 + 7 + 3 + 2*(√30 + √35 - √15 + √42 - √18 - √21)

Similarly for other terms. But when adding all four terms, the cross terms would have similar components, but with different signs. However, according to our previous analysis, they cancel out. But to be thorough, let me check if that's the case.

For example, consider the cross term involving √15. In Term1, we have -√15 (from √5*(-√3)). In Term2, which is (√3 - √5 + √6 + √7)^2, expanding would have cross terms like -√5*√3 (from -√5*√3), so similar to Term1. Wait, but when adding all four terms, each cross product term would appear with coefficients that cancel out. For example, the term involving √(ab) where a and b are two different square roots. Let me think about how many times each product appears with positive and negative signs.

But since we already did the general case and found that all cross terms cancel, and verified with the formula approach, perhaps it's safe to go with 84.

Therefore, the answer is 84.

Warning: Could not find any JSON in the response for question 79. Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the maximum possible volume of the remaining cheese after cutting ten 1 cm wide slices. The original block is 10x13x14 cm. So the original volume is 10*13*14. Let me calculate that first. 10*13 is 130, times 14 is... 130*14. Let me do 130*10=1300, 130*4=520, so total 1820 cm³. So original volume is 1820.

Now, we need to remove ten slices, each 1 cm thick, but they can be cut in any direction, as long as each is parallel to one face. The question is how to arrange these slices so that the total volume removed is minimized, so that the remaining volume is maximized. Because the problem asks for the maximum remaining volume after ten slices are cut off.

So the key here is to figure out how to cut the slices in such a way that they overlap as much as possible. Because if slices overlap, then the total volume removed is less than ten times 1 cm³. Wait, no. Wait, each slice is 1 cm thick. But if they overlap, then the total volume removed would be less than 10 cm³. Wait, but each slice is a 1 cm thick piece. But the volume of each slice depends on the area of the face it's cut from. For example, if you cut a slice parallel to the 10x13 face, then the volume of that slice is 10*13*1 = 130 cm³. But if you cut a slice parallel to the 10x14 face, then the volume is 10*14*1=140 cm³. Similarly, cutting parallel to the 13x14 face would be 13*14*1=182 cm³. So each slice's volume depends on which face it's parallel to.

But the problem says that each slice is 1 cm wide and cut parallel to one face. But the slices can be in different directions. However, if we want to minimize the total volume removed, we need to maximize the overlapping of the slices. However, since each slice is 1 cm thick, but depending on the direction, the same slice could be in different orientations. Wait, but how does overlapping work here?

Let me think. Suppose I have two slices. If they are both cut in the same direction, say both parallel to the 10x13 face. If I cut one slice from the front and another from the back, then they don't overlap. But if I cut them in the same direction but adjacent, then they might overlap? Wait, no. If you cut a slice of 1 cm in one direction, then another slice in the same direction, they can be adjacent, but not overlapping. Unless you cut in different directions. For example, if you have a slice parallel to the 10x13 face (so along the 14 cm dimension) and another slice parallel to the 10x14 face (so along the 13 cm dimension), then they might intersect. But how does that affect the total volume?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum remaining volume is achieved by removing as little as possible. So, to minimize the volume removed, we need to maximize the overlapping of the slices. Therefore, each subsequent slice should remove as little new volume as possible. But how?

Alternatively, think about the problem as trying to remove ten 1 cm layers, but in such a way that they overlap as much as possible. For example, if you can remove ten layers in the same direction, but since the cheese is only 10 cm in one dimension, you can't have more than 10 slices in that direction. Wait, the cheese has dimensions 10, 13, 14. So, for example, if you take slices along the 10 cm dimension, you can take up to 10 slices (each 1 cm thick) and remove the entire 10 cm length. Similarly, along the 13 cm dimension, you can take up to 13 slices, and along the 14 cm dimension, up to 14 slices.

But since we have only ten slices, perhaps the optimal way is to take as many slices as possible in the direction where the cheese is the smallest, so that we can remove as much as possible with minimal slices. Wait, but we want to remove as little as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that we need to remove ten slices. Each slice is 1 cm thick. But if you take slices in directions where they can overlap, then you can remove less volume. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the classic problem where you have a 3D object and you want to remove slices in such a way that the total volume removed is minimized. The minimal volume removed would be when the slices are arranged to overlap as much as possible. However, since each slice is 1 cm thick, but depending on the direction, the slices can be arranged to cover different parts.

Alternatively, think of it as the maximum remaining volume is original volume minus the minimal possible volume removed by ten slices. So we need to find the minimal volume that can be removed by ten slices.

But how to compute that?

Let me think of each slice as removing a 1 cm thick layer in some direction. However, if multiple slices are in the same direction, they can be stacked. For example, if you take ten slices all in the direction of the 10 cm side, then you can remove 10 cm, which is the entire length. So the volume removed would be 10*13*14? No, wait. Wait, no. If you take a slice parallel to the 13x14 face, then each slice is 1 cm thick along the 10 cm direction. So each slice has volume 13*14*1 = 182 cm³. If you take ten slices in that direction, but since the cheese is only 10 cm in that direction, taking ten slices would cover the entire 10 cm. However, the total volume removed would be 10*13*14? No, that can't be. Wait, no. If you take ten slices each of 1 cm in that direction, but since the cheese is 10 cm in that direction, the total volume removed is the entire volume of the cheese. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, no. If you take slices along the 10 cm direction, then each slice is a 1 cm thick layer. So the first slice removes 1 cm of the 10 cm side, so the volume is 13*14*1. The second slice, if adjacent, would be another 1 cm, so another 13*14*1. But if you take ten slices, then you would have removed 10*13*14? But that's the entire volume. But that's impossible, because the cheese is 10 cm in that direction. Wait, but 10 slices of 1 cm each would exactly cover the entire 10 cm. So the total volume removed would be 10*13*14? But that would be 10*13*14 = 1820 cm³, which is the entire volume. But that's not possible, because you can't remove the entire cheese by cutting ten slices. Wait, no. Wait, if you take ten slices each of 1 cm in the 10 cm direction, then each slice is 1 cm thick. So the first slice is 1 cm from one end, the next is another 1 cm, etc. But since the cheese is 10 cm in that direction, ten slices would exactly cover the entire cheese. So the total volume removed would be the entire cheese. But that would mean the remaining volume is zero, which is obviously not the maximum. Therefore, this approach is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says that ten slices are cut from the cheese. So the cheese is being cut into ten slices, but the question is about the remaining block. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "ten slices are cut from the cheese." So the cheese is being cut into pieces, and ten slices are removed, and we need the remaining volume. So if you remove ten slices, each of 1 cm thickness, but depending on how they are arranged, you can remove more or less volume.

But in the case where you take ten slices along the 10 cm direction, you would remove the entire cheese. So that's not helpful. But perhaps the key is that when you take slices in different directions, you can have overlaps. So if you take slices in different directions, the same part of the cheese can be removed by multiple slices, so the total volume removed is less than ten times the volume of a single slice.

But how to calculate that?

Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to remove ten 1 cm thick layers, but in such a way that they overlap as much as possible. The minimal total volume removed would be achieved when the slices are arranged to overlap as much as possible. So, for example, if all ten slices are in the same direction, then the total volume removed would be the volume of a 10 cm thick slice in that direction. For example, if you take ten slices in the 10 cm direction, you remove the entire 10 cm, so volume is 13*14*10 = 1820 cm³. Which is the entire cheese. But that's not helpful. But if you take slices in different directions, maybe you can remove less?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you take slices in different directions, you can remove parts of the cheese that are counted multiple times. For example, if you take a slice along the x-axis (say, 10 cm direction), and then a slice along the y-axis (13 cm direction), then their intersection is a small cube, which is removed by both slices. Therefore, the total volume removed is the sum of the volumes of each slice minus the volume of their intersection. But with multiple slices, the inclusion-exclusion principle would get complicated. However, since we want to minimize the total volume removed, maybe we can arrange the slices so that they overlap as much as possible.

But how?

Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to find the minimal volume that can be removed by ten slices. Each slice is a 1 cm thick slab, parallel to one of the faces. The minimal total volume removed would be when the slices are arranged to cover as much overlapping as possible. So, perhaps the optimal way is to remove slices in such a way that they all overlap in a single small region. However, given the dimensions of the cheese, how can we do that?

Alternatively, think of the problem as a 3D grid. Each slice removes a 1 cm layer in one direction. For example, if you take a slice in the x-direction (along the 10 cm side), it removes a 1 cm thick layer. Similarly for y and z directions.

But perhaps the minimal total volume is achieved by taking slices in different directions, such that each new slice removes as little new volume as possible. For example, first take a slice in the x-direction, then another in the y-direction, then another in the z-direction, etc., so that each new slice overlaps with the previous ones.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, think of it as the problem of covering the cheese with ten 1 cm thick slabs, but trying to cover as little volume as possible. However, since the slices are removed, not covered. Wait, but the problem is that each slice is removed, so the total removed volume is the union of all the slices. Therefore, to minimize the removed volume, we need to maximize the overlap between the slices.

So the problem reduces to: what is the minimal possible volume of the union of ten 1 cm thick slabs, each parallel to one of the faces of the cheese.

So the question is, how to arrange ten such slabs so that their union has minimal volume.

To find that, perhaps we can think of the maximum number of slabs that can be arranged to overlap in a single region.

For example, if we take all ten slices in the same direction, then their union is just a single slab of 10 cm thickness, which would have volume 13*14*10 = 1820 cm³, which is the entire cheese. But that's the maximum possible volume removed, not the minimum. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if we take slices in different directions, so that their union is a smaller volume.

For example, suppose we take one slice in the x-direction (10 cm), one in y (13 cm), one in z (14 cm). The union would be the volume of the three slabs minus their intersections. But calculating that is complicated. However, if we take multiple slices in different directions, perhaps overlapping in some way.

Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to find the maximum number of slices that can be arranged to cover a certain region, but since we have ten slices, we need to find the minimal union.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, maybe there's a mathematical way to model this. Let me think.

Let me denote the three dimensions as a=10, b=13, c=14.

Each slice can be in one of the three directions. Let me denote:

- A slice in the x-direction (along the a-axis) has thickness 1 cm. So if you take k slices in the x-direction, the total thickness removed in the x-direction is k cm. However, if you take more than a slices (which is 10), then you can't take more than that. Similarly for the other directions.

But the problem is that the slices can be in any direction, and overlapping. So the total volume removed is the volume of the union of all these slices.

To minimize this, we need to maximize overlaps.

But how?

An approach could be to model the maximum number of slices that can be taken in each direction without exceeding the cheese's dimensions, and then find the optimal combination.

Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to remove as much as possible in the directions where the cheese is larger, so that the same slice can cover more volume. Wait, no. Wait, if you take a slice in the direction where the cheese is larger, then the volume of that slice is larger. For example, a slice in the z-direction (14 cm) has volume a*b*1 = 10*13*1=130 cm³. Whereas a slice in the y-direction (13 cm) has volume a*c*1=10*14*1=140 cm³. Wait, no. Wait, the volume of a slice depends on the two dimensions perpendicular to the direction of the slice. For example:

- A slice parallel to the y-z face (i.e., cutting along the x-axis) has volume b*c*1 = 13*14*1 = 182 cm³.

- A slice parallel to the x-z face (cutting along the y-axis) has volume a*c*1 = 10*14*1 = 140 cm³.

- A slice parallel to the x-y face (cutting along the z-axis) has volume a*b*1 = 10*13*1 = 130 cm³.

So slices in the x-direction (along the 10 cm side) are the largest, then y-direction (13 cm), then z-direction (14 cm). Wait, no. Wait, if you cut along the x-axis, the slice is parallel to the y-z face, so the volume is y*z*thickness. Since the thickness is 1 cm, then the volume is 13*14*1 = 182 cm³. Similarly, cutting along the y-axis (parallel to x-z face) gives 10*14*1=140 cm³. Cutting along the z-axis (parallel to x-y face) gives 10*13*1=130 cm³. So slices along the x-axis are the largest, then y, then z.

Therefore, if we want to minimize the total volume removed, we should take as many slices as possible in the direction with the smallest volume per slice, i.e., the z-direction (130 cm³ per slice). Because each slice in the z-direction removes less volume than in other directions. However, if we take slices in the z-direction, which is the 14 cm side, then we can take up to 14 slices (each 1 cm thick) along the z-axis. But since we have only ten slices, taking all ten in the z-direction would remove 10*130 = 1300 cm³. However, if we take slices in other directions, maybe we can have overlaps and remove less.

But this seems contradictory. Because if you take ten slices in the z-direction, each of 1 cm thickness, then the total volume removed is 10*130 = 1300 cm³. However, if you take ten slices in the x-direction, it would be 10*182 = 1820 cm³, which is worse. So taking slices in the z-direction is better for minimizing the volume removed. But maybe if you take slices in different directions, you can have overlaps and remove less.

Wait, but how? For example, if you take one slice in the z-direction (removing 130 cm³) and then another slice in the z-direction, overlapping with the first one. But since they are both in the same direction, they can't overlap unless they are adjacent. Wait, no. If you take two slices in the z-direction, they can be adjacent or overlapping? Wait, no. If you take a slice in the z-direction, it's a 1 cm thick layer along the z-axis. So if you take two slices in the z-direction, they have to be in different positions along the z-axis. So they can't overlap. Because the cheese is 14 cm in the z-direction. So if you take two slices in the z-direction, they are two separate 1 cm layers, so their total volume is 2*130 = 260 cm³. So there's no overlap. Therefore, taking multiple slices in the same direction doesn't lead to overlapping. Therefore, the total volume removed is just the number of slices multiplied by the volume per slice in that direction.

But if you take slices in different directions, they might overlap. For example, take one slice in the z-direction (removing 130 cm³) and one slice in the y-direction (removing 140 cm³). The intersection of these two slices is a 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm cube? Wait, no. Let me think.

If you take a slice in the z-direction (parallel to x-y face), it's a layer of 1 cm thickness along the z-axis. So imagine cutting the cheese horizontally (along z-axis), removing a 1 cm thick layer. Similarly, a slice in the y-direction is a layer of 1 cm thickness along the y-axis, which would be like cutting vertically along the y-axis. The intersection of these two slices would be a 1 cm x 1 cm x 10 cm (if the slice in y-direction is along the y-axis, then its thickness is 1 cm in y, so the intersection would be a region where both the z and y slices are present. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize.

Let me consider coordinates. Let me assume the cheese is a rectangular prism with dimensions x from 0 to 10, y from 0 to 13, z from 0 to 14.

A slice in the z-direction (parallel to x-y face) would be, for example, all points where z is between a and a+1, for some a. Similarly, a slice in the y-direction would be all points where y is between b and b+1, for some b. The intersection of these two slices is the set of points where z is between a and a+1 and y is between b and b+1. So this is a rectangular prism of size 10 (x-axis) x 1 (y-axis) x 1 (z-axis), which has volume 10*1*1=10 cm³. So when you take two slices, one in z and one in y, their intersection is 10 cm³. Therefore, the total volume removed by both slices is 130 + 140 - 10 = 260 cm³. So by taking two slices in different directions, you remove less total volume than if you took two slices in the same direction (which would be 130*2 = 260 cm³, same as this case). Wait, so in this case, it's the same. Hmm. So maybe overlapping doesn't help here?

Wait, but in this case, the total volume removed is the same. So maybe overlapping doesn't help? Wait, but if you take three slices: one in z, one in y, one in x. Let's compute the total volume.

First, the first slice in z: 130 cm³.

Second slice in y: 140 cm³, overlapping with the first slice by 10 cm³. So total so far: 130 + 140 - 10 = 260.

Third slice in x: which is a slice parallel to y-z face, thickness 1 cm in x-direction. Volume is 13*14*1 = 182 cm³. Now, what is the overlap with the previous slices?

The overlap with the z-slice: the intersection is a region where x is between 0 and 1 (assuming the x-slice is at x=0 to 1), z between a and a+1, and y between b and b+1. Wait, the overlap between the x-slice and z-slice is a 1 cm (x) x 13 cm (y) x 1 cm (z) region? Wait, no. The x-slice is 1 cm in x, full y and z. The z-slice is full x and y, 1 cm in z. Their intersection is 1 cm (x) x 13 cm (y) x 1 cm (z), which is 1*13*1 = 13 cm³. Similarly, the overlap between x-slice and y-slice is 1 cm (x) x 1 cm (y) x 14 cm (z) = 14 cm³. The overlap between all three slices is 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm = 1 cm³.

So using inclusion-exclusion, the total volume would be:

130 (z) + 140 (y) + 182 (x) - 10 (z∩y) - 13 (z∩x) - 14 (y∩x) + 1 (z∩y∩x).

Calculating that:

130 + 140 + 182 = 452

Subtract 10 + 13 + 14 = 37 → 452 - 37 = 415

Add back 1 → 416 cm³.

If instead, we had taken three slices in the z-direction, the total volume would be 3*130 = 390 cm³, which is less than 416. So in this case, taking slices in different directions leads to a larger total volume removed. Therefore, this approach is worse. So perhaps taking slices in different directions is not helpful for minimizing the volume removed.

But this seems counterintuitive. Why would overlapping slices lead to a larger volume removed? Because the inclusion-exclusion principle subtracts overlaps, but in this case, the overlaps are small compared to the individual slice volumes.

So maybe the minimal total volume is achieved by taking all slices in the same direction, but that seems contradictory to the previous thought. Wait, but in the case of taking three slices in the same direction (z), the total volume is 390 cm³, which is less than the 416 cm³ when taking slices in different directions. Therefore, taking slices in the same direction is better for minimizing the volume removed.

But then why would we ever take slices in different directions? It seems that taking slices in the same direction gives a smaller total volume removed. However, if we take slices in different directions, but in such a way that they overlap more?

Wait, but in the previous example, taking slices in different directions led to more volume removed. So maybe the minimal total volume is achieved by taking all slices in the same direction. But then, if we take all ten slices in the same direction, say the z-direction, then the total volume removed is 10*130 = 1300 cm³. However, if we take ten slices in the x-direction, it would be 10*182 = 1820 cm³, which is worse. Similarly, in the y-direction, it would be 10*140 = 1400 cm³. So taking all slices in the z-direction is better.

But is there a way to take slices in different directions to get a smaller total volume?

Wait, suppose we take some slices in the z-direction and some in the y-direction. Let's say we take k slices in the z-direction and (10 - k) slices in the y-direction. What is the total volume removed?

Assuming that all slices are non-overlapping in their respective directions. For example, if we take k slices in the z-direction, each 1 cm thick, non-overlapping, then the total volume from z-slices is k * 130. Similarly, the y-slices are (10 - k) * 140. However, if there is any overlap between the z-slices and y-slices, then the total volume would be less. But how much overlap?

But if the slices are arranged such that they don't overlap, then the total volume is k*130 + (10 - k)*140. To minimize this, we need to choose k to minimize the expression. Let's compute it:

Total volume = 130k + 140(10 - k) = 130k + 1400 - 140k = 1400 - 10k.

To minimize this, we need to maximize k. Since k can be up to 10 (all slices in z-direction), then the minimal total volume would be 1400 - 10*10 = 1400 - 100 = 1300 cm³. Which is the same as taking all slices in the z-direction. Therefore, even if you take some slices in different directions, the minimal total volume is still achieved by taking all in the z-direction.

So this suggests that taking all slices in the same direction (the one with the smallest slice volume) is optimal.

But wait, what if we take slices in different directions but overlapping? For example, take one slice in the z-direction and one slice in the y-direction, which overlap. Then the total volume removed would be 130 + 140 - overlap. If the overlap is significant, maybe this could be less than 130 + 140 = 270. But in the earlier example, the overlap was 10 cm³, leading to total volume 130 + 140 - 10 = 260, which is less than 270. But if we take two slices in the z-direction, the total volume would be 2*130 = 260, same as this. So same result. Therefore, whether you take two slices in the same direction or one in each direction with overlap, you get the same total volume.

But if you take more slices, how does it go?

Suppose we take two slices in the z-direction and one slice in the y-direction. Total volume would be 2*130 + 140 - overlaps. But overlaps between the two z-slices and the y-slice.

But this is getting complicated. However, from the previous example, it seems that taking slices in different directions doesn't help reduce the total volume below what you'd get by taking all slices in the same direction.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal total volume removed is achieved by taking all ten slices in the direction where each slice has the smallest volume, which is the z-direction (parallel to x-y face), removing 10*130 = 1300 cm³. Therefore, the remaining volume would be 1820 - 1300 = 520 cm³.

But wait, but the cheese is 14 cm in the z-direction. If we take ten slices in the z-direction, each 1 cm thick, then we are removing 10 cm of the z-direction. So the remaining cheese would be 14 - 10 = 4 cm in the z-direction. Therefore, the remaining volume would be 10*13*4 = 520 cm³. Which matches the calculation above.

But is this the maximum possible remaining volume?

Wait, but what if we take some slices in other directions? For example, suppose we take some slices in the z-direction and some in the x or y directions, but in such a way that we remove less total volume. But according to the previous reasoning, that doesn't seem possible. However, let's test another scenario.

Suppose we take 10 slices in the y-direction. Each slice has volume 10*14*1 = 140 cm³. Total volume removed would be 10*140 = 1400 cm³. Remaining volume is 1820 - 1400 = 420 cm³, which is less than 520. So worse.

If we take 10 slices in the x-direction: 10*182 = 1820, remaining volume 0. Worse.

Alternatively, take some slices in different directions. For example, take 10 slices in the z-direction, but only remove 10 cm of the z-direction. But that's what we did earlier. Alternatively, take some slices in different directions to remove parts of the cheese that are not along the same axis.

Wait, but what if we take slices in different directions such that they remove parts of the cheese in a way that allows more of the cheese to remain? For example, if we take slices that are in different orientations but remove less total volume.

But according to the previous calculation, taking slices in different directions doesn't help. However, there might be another approach.

Let me think differently. The problem is similar to the problem of cutting the maximum number of slices with minimal total volume, which is equivalent to covering the cheese with as few slices as possible, but we have exactly ten slices. But I need to minimize the total volume removed.

Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to find the maximum volume that can remain after removing ten slices. So the remaining cheese is the original volume minus the union of the ten slices. To maximize the remaining volume, we need to minimize the union of the ten slices.

So how can we arrange ten slices to have the smallest possible union?

The minimal possible union would be achieved by having as much overlap as possible between the slices. For example, if all ten slices overlap in a single small region, then the union is just that region. But given that each slice is 1 cm thick, and the cheese has dimensions 10x13x14, what's the minimal possible union?

The minimal possible union would be the volume of a single 1 cm thick slice, but we have ten slices. However, since we have to take ten slices, even if they all overlap perfectly, the union is still the volume of one slice. But that's impossible because each slice is 1 cm thick, and you can't have ten slices overlapping perfectly in a single region unless they are all the same slice. But the problem says ten slices are cut, so they must be distinct slices. Therefore, they cannot all be the same slice. Therefore, the minimal union is larger than the volume of one slice.

But how much larger?

Let me think. Suppose we take ten slices, each of which overlaps with the others as much as possible. For example, take ten slices all in the z-direction, but each 1 cm thick, but arranged such that they are all overlapping in the same region. But in reality, slices in the same direction cannot overlap unless they are adjacent. Wait, no. If you take a slice in the z-direction at position z=0-1, and another slice at z=0-1, they are the same slice. But the problem says ten slices are cut, so they must be distinct. Therefore, you cannot have overlapping slices in the same direction. Therefore, in the same direction, each slice must be in a different position, hence non-overlapping. Therefore, the total volume removed in that case is ten times the volume of one slice.

But if you take slices in different directions, you can have overlapping. For example, take one slice in the z-direction (removing a 1 cm layer), and then another slice in the y-direction (removing a 1 cm layer). These two slices overlap in a region of 10*1*1 cm³. So the total union is 130 + 140 - 10 = 260 cm³. Which is less than 2*130 = 260 cm³ (if you took two slices in the z-direction). Wait, same volume. So no gain.

If you take three slices: one in z, one in y, one in x. The union is 130 + 140 + 182 - overlaps. As calculated before, it was 416 cm³. Whereas three slices in z-direction would be 3*130=390 cm³. So worse.

Alternatively, take ten slices in different directions, but how? Since there are only three directions. So you can have multiple slices in each direction. For example, take k slices in z, m slices in y, n slices in x, with k + m + n = 10.

To minimize the total volume, we need to choose k, m, n such that the total union is minimized. But how to calculate that?

This seems complex. However, perhaps the minimal total volume is achieved when we take as many slices as possible in the direction with the smallest slice volume (z), and then take the remaining slices in other directions, but with overlaps.

But earlier calculations showed that taking slices in different directions doesn't help. However, let's consider a different approach.

Suppose we take all ten slices in the z-direction. Then the union is 10*130 = 1300 cm³, as before.

Alternatively, suppose we take nine slices in the z-direction (removing 9 cm of z), and one slice in the y-direction. The total volume removed would be 9*130 + 140 - overlap. The overlap between the y-slice and the z-slices is the intersection between the y-slice and the nine z-slices. The y-slice is a 1 cm thick layer in the y-direction, which is 10*1*14 = 140 cm³. The nine z-slices are 9 cm thick in the z-direction, so the overlap between the y-slice and the z-slices is 10*1*9 = 90 cm³. Therefore, the total volume removed is 9*130 + 140 - 90 = 1170 + 140 - 90 = 1220 cm³. Which is less than 1300 cm³. Wait, this is better! So this is a better way.

So this suggests that taking some slices in different directions can lead to less total volume removed. Therefore, my previous reasoning was incorrect.

Let me verify this calculation. The nine z-slices remove 9 cm in the z-direction, volume 9*130 = 1170. The one y-slice removes 1 cm in the y-direction, volume 140. However, the overlap between the y-slice and the z-slices is the region that is in both the y-slice and the nine z-slices. The y-slice is a 1 cm thick layer in the y-direction (say, from y=0 to y=1). The nine z-slices are from z=0 to z=9. So the intersection is the region from x=0-10, y=0-1, z=0-9. The volume of this intersection is 10*1*9 = 90 cm³. Therefore, the total volume removed is 1170 + 140 - 90 = 1220 cm³. Which is indeed less than 1300. So this is better.

So this suggests that combining slices in different directions can lead to less total volume removed. Therefore, the previous approach of taking all slices in one direction is not optimal.

So how can we generalize this?

Let me think. Suppose we take k slices in the z-direction (removing k cm in z), and m slices in the y-direction (removing m cm in y), and n slices in the x-direction (removing n cm in x), with k + m + n = 10. The total volume removed would be:

Volume_z + Volume_y + Volume_x - Volume_overlap_z_y - Volume_overlap_z_x - Volume_overlap_y_x + Volume_overlap_z_y_x.

But calculating this is complex. However, if we assume that the slices are arranged in such a way that all overlaps are maximized, i.e., the slices in different directions are all overlapping in a common region.

For example, if all slices are arranged to overlap in the region x=0-1, y=0-1, z=0-1. But this is not possible unless the slices are specifically placed there. However, for simplicity, let's assume that all slices are placed in such a way that they overlap as much as possible.

But this is too vague. Let's try to find a pattern from the previous example.

In the example where we took 9 slices in z and 1 in y, the total volume removed was 1220. Let's see what happens if we take 8 slices in z and 2 in y.

Volume_z = 8*130 = 1040.

Volume_y = 2*140 = 280.

Overlap between z and y slices: each y-slice overlaps with the z-slices. Assuming the two y-slices are placed in different parts of the y-direction, say y=0-1 and y=1-2. Then the overlap with the z-slices (which are in z=0-8) would be for each y-slice: 10*1*8 = 80 cm³ per y-slice. So total overlap is 2*80 = 160 cm³.

Therefore, total volume removed is 1040 + 280 - 160 = 1160 cm³. Which is better than 1220.

Similarly, if we take 7 z-slices and 3 y-slices:

Volume_z = 7*130 = 910.

Volume_y = 3*140 = 420.

Overlap: 3*10*1*7 = 210.

Total volume removed: 910 + 420 - 210 = 1120 cm³.

Continuing this pattern:

k z-slices and (10 - k) y-slices.

Total volume removed = 130k + 140(10 - k) - 10*(10 - k)*k.

Wait, no. Wait, the overlap between each y-slice and the z-slices is 10*1*k, since the z-slices are k cm thick. So if there are (10 - k) y-slices, each overlapping with the z-slices by 10*1*k cm³. So total overlap is (10 - k)*10*k.

Wait, but in the previous example with k=9, (10 - k)=1, overlap was 10*1*9 = 90, which matches. For k=8, (10 - k)=2, overlap is 2*10*8 = 160, which matches. So general formula:

Total volume removed = 130k + 140(10 - k) - 10k(10 - k).

Let me compute this:

= 130k + 1400 - 140k - 100k + 10k²

Wait:

Wait, expanding:

130k + 140*(10 - k) - 10k*(10 - k)

= 130k + 1400 - 140k - 10k*(10 - k)

= (130k - 140k) + 1400 - 10k*(10 - k)

= -10k + 1400 - 100k + 10k²

= 10k² - 110k + 1400.

So the total volume removed is 10k² - 110k + 1400.

To find the minimum of this quadratic function in k, we can take derivative or find the vertex.

The quadratic is 10k² - 110k + 1400. The vertex is at k = -b/(2a) = 110/(2*10) = 5.5.

Since k must be integer between 0 and 10, we check k=5 and k=6.

For k=5:

Total volume = 10*(25) - 110*5 + 1400 = 250 - 550 + 1400 = 1100 cm³.

For k=6:

Total volume = 10*(36) - 110*6 + 1400 = 360 - 660 + 1400 = 1100 cm³.

So both k=5 and k=6 give total volume removed of 1100 cm³.

This is better than the previous example of 1120. So this suggests that taking 5 slices in z and 5 in y, or 6 and 4, gives a total volume removed of 1100 cm³. Which is better than taking all in z (1300). So this is a better approach.

Now, what if we take slices in all three directions? Let's see if we can get even less.

Suppose we take k slices in z, m slices in y, and n slices in x, with k + m + n = 10. How to calculate the total volume removed?

This is more complex, but let's try a simple case. Let's say we take 5 slices in z, 3 in y, and 2 in x.

But calculating overlaps would require inclusion-exclusion. However, if we assume that all slices overlap in a common region, the overlaps would be significant. But it's complicated.

Alternatively, let's try to extend the previous approach. Suppose we take k slices in z, m slices in y, and n slices in x, with k + m + n = 10. Assuming that all slices are arranged to overlap as much as possible, i.e., all slices are in the same region. For example, all slices are in the region x=0-1, y=0-1, z=0-1. But since each slice is 1 cm thick, this would require that the slices are arranged to cover this region from different directions.

However, this is not straightforward. Alternatively, think that the total volume removed would be the volume of the union of all slices. If all slices overlap in a common region, the union is the volume of the region covered by any of the slices. But it's difficult to model.

Alternatively, think of it as follows: if we take slices in all three directions, the maximum overlap would be such that the union is a small cuboid. For example, if we take slices in all three directions such that they all overlap in a 1x1x1 cube, then the union would be a larger cuboid. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, let's consider that taking slices in different directions allows us to remove more of the cheese in different dimensions, but with overlaps. However, the previous calculation with two directions already gave us a better result than taking all in one direction. Perhaps taking slices in all three directions can do even better?

Let me try an example. Suppose we take 5 slices in z, 3 in y, and 2 in x. Let's calculate the total volume removed, assuming that overlaps are maximized.

But this is complex. Let's use inclusion-exclusion:

Total volume = V_z + V_y + V_x - V_z∩y - V_z∩x - V_y∩x + V_z∩y∩x.

Where:

V_z = 5*130 = 650

V_y = 3*140 = 420

V_x = 2*182 = 364

Now, overlaps:

Assuming that all slices are arranged to overlap as much as possible. Let's assume that all slices intersect in a common region. For example, all z-slices are in the same z-region, all y-slices in the same y-region, and all x-slices in the same x-region. Let's say:

- z-slices are from z=0-5 (5 cm thick)

- y-slices are from y=0-3 (3 cm thick)

- x-slices are from x=0-2 (2 cm thick)

Then the intersection of all three slices is x=0-2, y=0-3, z=0-5. The volume of this region is 2*3*5 = 30 cm³.

But the overlaps between pairs:

V_z∩y = the intersection of z-slices and y-slices. This would be x=0-10, y=0-3, z=0-5. Volume is 10*3*5 = 150 cm³.

Similarly, V_z∩x = x=0-2, y=0-13, z=0-5. Volume is 2*13*5 = 130 cm³.

V_y∩x = x=0-2, y=0-3, z=0-14. Volume is 2*3*14 = 84 cm³.

And V_z∩y∩x = 30 cm³ as above.

So total volume removed:

650 + 420 + 364 - 150 - 130 - 84 + 30 = 

Let's compute step by step:

650 + 420 = 1070

1070 + 364 = 1434

Subtract 150 + 130 + 84 = 364 → 1434 - 364 = 1070

Add 30 → 1070 + 30 = 1100 cm³.

Same as before! So total volume removed is 1100 cm³, same as when taking 5 z and 5 y slices. Interesting.

So even with three directions, the total volume removed is the same. This suggests that the minimal total volume removed is 1100 cm³, regardless of how we arrange the slices, as long as the total number of slices is 10 and the overlaps are maximized.

But is this the minimum?

Let me try another configuration. Suppose we take 4 slices in z, 3 in y, and 3 in x. Let's calculate.

V_z = 4*130 = 520

V_y = 3*140 = 420

V_x = 3*182 = 546

Total sum: 520 + 420 + 546 = 1486

Now overlaps:

Assume z-slices are z=0-4, y-slices y=0-3, x-slices x=0-3.

V_z∩y = 10*3*4 = 120

V_z∩x = 3*13*4 = 156

V_y∩x = 3*3*14 = 126

V_z∩y∩x = 3*3*4 = 36

Total volume removed: 1486 - (120 + 156 + 126) + 36 = 1486 - 402 + 36 = 1486 - 366 = 1120 cm³. Which is worse than 1100.

So this configuration is worse.

Another example: 6 slices in z, 2 in y, 2 in x.

V_z = 6*130 = 780

V_y = 2*140 = 280

V_x = 2*182 = 364

Total sum: 780 + 280 + 364 = 1424

Overlaps:

Assume z=0-6, y=0-2, x=0-2.

V_z∩y = 10*2*6 = 120

V_z∩x = 2*13*6 = 156

V_y∩x = 2*2*14 = 56

V_z∩y∩x = 2*2*6 = 24

Total volume removed: 1424 - (120 + 156 + 56) + 24 = 1424 - 332 + 24 = 1424 - 308 = 1116 cm³. Still worse than 1100.

So the previous case of 1100 seems better.

What if we take 5 slices in z, 2 in y, 3 in x?

V_z = 5*130 = 650

V_y = 2*140 = 280

V_x = 3*182 = 546

Total sum: 650 + 280 + 546 = 1476

Overlaps:

Assume z=0-5, y=0-2, x=0-3.

V_z∩y = 10*2*5 = 100

V_z∩x = 3*13*5 = 195

V_y∩x = 3*2*14 = 84

V_z∩y∩x = 3*2*5 = 30

Total volume removed: 1476 - (100 + 195 + 84) + 30 = 1476 - 379 + 30 = 1476 - 349 = 1127 cm³. Worse than 1100.

So seems like the minimal total volume removed is 1100 cm³, achieved by various configurations, such as 5 z and 5 y slices, or 5 z, 3 y, 2 x slices, etc.

But can we do better than 1100?

Let me try another approach. Suppose we take slices in all three directions, but arrange them to have more overlaps. For example, take 3 slices in each direction and 1 extra slice in one direction.

But this is getting too arbitrary. Let's think of the general case where we take k slices in z, m in y, n in x, with k + m + n = 10.

Assuming that all slices are arranged to overlap in a common region, the total volume removed would be the volume of the union, which is:

Volume = (a * b * c) - (remaining volume). But I need to find Volume removed.

Alternatively, if we assume that the slices are arranged such that they all overlap in a common cuboid, then the union would be the maximum of the extensions in each direction.

For example, if we take k slices in z, m in y, n in x, and they are all arranged to overlap in the region x=0-1, y=0-1, z=0-1, then the union would be:

In the x-direction: the slices in x would extend from 0-1, but also if there are slices in other directions, they might extend further. Wait, this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of it as the union being a cuboid with dimensions:

x: max(1, ...), y: max(1, ...), z: max(1, ...). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if we take k slices in z, each 1 cm thick, arranged in the z-direction, and similarly for y and x, but all overlapping in a common region, then the union would be a cuboid with dimensions:

In x-direction: if there are n slices in x, each 1 cm thick, then the total length in x would be n cm (assuming they are stacked). Similarly for y and z.

But if they are all overlapping in a common region, then the total union would be the maximum of the lengths in each direction.

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Let's think of it as follows: if you take k slices in the z-direction, they remove a 1 cm thick layer each, but if they are arranged to overlap in the same region, then effectively they remove a 1 cm thick layer in the z-direction. But that's not helpful. Wait, no. If you take multiple slices in the same direction, they have to be in different positions, so they don't overlap. So the total length removed in the z-direction is k cm.

Similarly, for y and x.

But if you take slices in different directions, they can overlap in the common region. For example, taking slices in x, y, z directions can remove a cuboid of size (n x m x k), where n, m, k are the number of slices in each direction. Wait, no. If you take n slices in x-direction (each 1 cm thick), m in y, and k in z, and they are arranged such that they all overlap in a common region, then the union would be a cuboid of size n x m x k. But this is only if each slice is placed in such a way that they extend from 0 to n in x, 0 to m in y, and 0 to k in z. But this would require that the slices are placed in the beginning of each axis.

But in this case, the volume removed would be n * m * k. Wait, but this seems like a different approach. Let me think.

For example, if we take n slices in the x-direction, each 1 cm thick, placed from x=0 to x=n. Similarly, m slices in y from y=0 to y=m, and k slices in z from z=0 to z=k. The union of these slices would be the cuboid from (0,0,0) to (n, m, k). The volume of this cuboid is n * m * k. However, the original cheese is 10x13x14. So n ≤ 10, m ≤ 13, k ≤ 14.

But we have n + m + k = 10 slices. Wait, no. Each slice is in a different direction. For example, n slices in x, m in y, k in z, with n + m + k = 10.

But the volume removed would be n * m * k? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the slices are in different directions. For example, n slices in x would remove a volume of n * b * c, where b and c are the other dimensions. Similarly for others. But if they are arranged to overlap, the total volume is not simply n * m * k.

But this line of thinking might not be correct. However, let's test with the previous example where k=5, m=5, n=0 (taking 5 slices in z and 5 in y). According to this idea, if we take 5 slices in z (removing 5 cm in z) and 5 slices in y (removing 5 cm in y), the union would be a cuboid of 10 (x) x 5 (y) x 5 (z), volume 10*5*5 = 250 cm³. But earlier calculation said the total volume removed was 1100 cm³. This is a contradiction. So this approach is wrong.

Therefore, this suggests that the previous inclusion-exclusion approach is necessary.

But given that in the previous examples, taking 5 slices in z and 5 in y gives total volume removed of 1100 cm³, and taking slices in all three directions can also give the same, it seems that 1100 is a candidate for the minimal total volume removed.

But can we do better?

Let me think of another configuration. Suppose we take 10 slices all in the z and y directions, but arranged such that they remove a larger overlapping region. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, think of the problem as trying to maximize the overlaps between slices. The more slices you have in different directions, the more overlaps you can have. But in the previous example, taking 5 in z and 5 in y gave 1100, and taking slices in all three directions also gave 1100. So maybe 1100 is the minimal.

But let's try another approach. Suppose we take slices in all three directions such that the total number of slices is 10, and the overlaps are maximized.

For example, take 3 slices in x, 3 in y, and 4 in z. Let's calculate the total volume removed using inclusion-exclusion.

Assume the slices are arranged to overlap as much as possible. Let's say:

- x-slices are from x=0-3 (3 cm thick)

- y-slices from y=0-3 (3 cm thick)

- z-slices from z=0-4 (4 cm thick)

Then:

V_x = 3*182 = 546

V_y = 3*140 = 420

V_z = 4*130 = 520

Total sum: 546 + 420 + 520 = 1486

Overlaps:

V_x∩y = 3*3*14 = 126 (since x=0-3, y=0-3, full z)

Wait, no. The intersection of x-slices and y-slices would be the region where x is in 0-3 and y is in 0-3, and z is anything? No, the slices are in different directions. The x-slices are 1 cm thick in x, so if we have 3 slices in x, they are 3 cm thick in x. Similarly for y and z.

But the intersection of the x-slices and y-slices would be the region where x is in 0-3, y is in 0-3, and z is anything? No, the slices are in different directions. The x-slices are layers in x-direction, so they cover full y and z. Similarly, y-slices cover full x and z. The intersection of x-slices and y-slices is the region covered by both: x=0-3, y=0-3, and z=0-14. The volume is 3*3*14 = 126 cm³.

Similarly, V_x∩z is x=0-3, y=0-13, z=0-4 → 3*13*4 = 156 cm³.

V_y∩z is x=0-10, y=0-3, z=0-4 → 10*3*4 = 120 cm³.

V_x∩y∩z is x=0-3, y=0-3, z=0-4 → 3*3*4 = 36 cm³.

So total volume removed is:

1486 - (126 + 156 + 120) + 36 = 1486 - 402 + 36 = 1486 - 366 = 1120 cm³, which is worse than 1100.

So again, 1100 seems better.

Is there a way to get lower than 1100?

Let me think of another configuration: take 4 slices in z, 4 in y, and 2 in x.

V_z = 4*130 = 520

V_y = 4*140 = 560

V_x = 2*182 = 364

Total sum: 520 + 560 + 364 = 1444

Overlaps:

Assume z=0-4, y=0-4, x=0-2.

V_z∩y = 10*4*4 = 160

V_z∩x = 2*13*4 = 104

V_y∩x = 2*4*14 = 112

V_z∩y∩x = 2*4*4 = 32

Total volume removed: 1444 - (160 + 104 + 112) + 32 = 1444 - 376 + 32 = 1444 - 344 = 1100 cm³.

Same as before! So this configuration also gives 1100.

So it seems that 1100 is achievable with various configurations. Is this the minimum?

Let me try to see if I can get lower. Suppose I take 6 slices in z, 3 in y, and 1 in x.

V_z = 6*130 = 780

V_y = 3*140 = 420

V_x = 1*182 = 182

Total sum: 780 + 420 + 182 = 1382

Overlaps:

Assume z=0-6, y=0-3, x=0-1.

V_z∩y = 10*3*6 = 180

V_z∩x = 1*13*6 = 78

V_y∩x = 1*3*14 = 42

V_z∩y∩x = 1*3*6 = 18

Total volume removed: 1382 - (180 + 78 + 42) + 18 = 1382 - 300 + 18 = 1382 - 282 = 1100 cm³.

Again, 1100. So it seems that no matter how I arrange the slices, as long as the overlaps are maximized, the total volume removed is 1100 cm³. This suggests that 1100 is the minimal possible volume removed.

But why is this the case? Let me think about it mathematically.

In the earlier example where we took k slices in z and (10 - k) in y, we derived the total volume removed as 10k² - 110k + 1400, which had its minimum at k=5.5, giving 1100 cm³. This suggests that 1100 is the minimum when considering only two directions. And when adding a third direction, it seems we can't get lower than that.

Therefore, it's likely that the minimal volume removed is 1100 cm³, leading to the remaining volume of 1820 - 1100 = 720 cm³.

But wait, let me confirm this with another approach.

Suppose we think of the problem as trying to remove as much as possible from the cheese with ten slices, but in such a way that the removed volume is minimized. However, this seems contradictory. Wait, no: we want to remove ten slices, but to have the remaining volume as large as possible, we need to remove as little as possible. So the minimal total volume removed is 1100, leading to 1820 - 1100 = 720.

But let me check with another example. Suppose we take 10 slices in the z and y directions such that they remove a 10x10x10 cube. Wait, but the cheese is 10x13x14. So if we take 10 slices in z (removing 10 cm in z) and 10 slices in y (removing 10 cm in y), but we only have 10 slices total. So it's not possible.

Alternatively, if we take 5 slices in z (removing 5 cm in z) and 5 slices in y (removing 5 cm in y), then the removed volume is the union of these slices, which is a 10x5x14 (from y-slices) plus 10x13x5 (from z-slices) minus the intersection 10x5x5. So total volume removed is 10*5*14 + 10*13*5 - 10*5*5 = 700 + 650 - 250 = 1100 cm³. Which matches our previous result.

Yes! This is a simpler way to calculate it. The volume removed by the y-slices is 10*13*5 (wait, no). Wait, the y-slices are 5 slices, each 1 cm thick in y-direction. Each slice has volume 10*14*1 = 140 cm³. Total for 5 slices is 5*140 = 700 cm³. Similarly, z-slices are 5 slices, each 130 cm³, total 650 cm³. The intersection is 10*5*5 = 250 cm³. So total volume removed is 700 + 650 - 250 = 1100 cm³. Exactly.

Therefore, this confirms that the minimal total volume removed is 1100 cm³, leading to a remaining volume of 1820 - 1100 = 720 cm³.

But wait, is there a way to remove even less volume by taking slices in all three directions? For example, if we take slices in x, y, and z directions such that their union is smaller than 1100.

Let me think. Suppose we take slices in all three directions such that they remove a cuboid of size a x b x c, where a + b + c = 10. Wait, no. Each slice is 1 cm thick in one direction. So if we take a slices in x, b in y, c in z, with a + b + c = 10, then the union would be a cuboid of size a x b x c? No, that's not correct. For example, if you take a slices in x, they remove a 1 cm thick layer each in x-direction, so total a cm in x. Similarly for y and z. But the union of these slices would be the region where x ≤ a or y ≤ b or z ≤ c. The volume of this region is:

Volume = a*13*14 + b*10*14 + c*10*13 - a*b*14 - a*c*13 - b*c*10 + a*b*c.

This is similar to inclusion-exclusion. Let's compute this:

Volume = 14*13*a + 14*10*b + 13*10*c - 14*a*b - 13*a*c - 10*b*c + a*b*c.

We want to minimize this expression subject to a + b + c = 10, where a, b, c are non-negative integers.

Let me substitute c = 10 - a - b.

Then the expression becomes:

14*13*a + 14*10*b + 13*10*(10 - a - b) - 14*a*b - 13*a*(10 - a - b) - 10*b*(10 - a - b) + a*b*(10 - a - b).

This is very complex, but let's try plugging in some values.

For example, take a=5, b=5, c=0:

Volume = 14*13*5 + 14*10*5 + 13*10*0 - 14*5*5 - 13*5*0 - 10*5*0 + 5*5*0 = 910 + 700 + 0 - 350 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 1610 - 350 = 1260 cm³. Which is higher than 1100.

Wait, but earlier calculation for a=5, b=5, c=0 (taking 5 slices in z and 5 in y) gave 1100. This suggests a discrepancy. What's wrong here?

Ah, because in this formula, a is the number of slices in x, b in y, c in z. But earlier, when we took 5 slices in z and 5 in y, that would correspond to a=0, b=5, c=5. Let's try that.

a=0, b=5, c=5:

Volume = 14*13*0 + 14*10*5 + 13*10*5 - 14*0*5 - 13*0*5 - 10*5*5 + 0*5*5 = 0 + 700 + 650 - 0 - 0 - 250 + 0 = 1350 - 250 = 1100 cm³. Which matches! So this formula works.

Now, let's try a=5, b=3, c=2 (taking 5 slices in x, 3 in y, 2 in z). Let's compute:

Volume = 14*13*5 + 14*10*3 + 13*10*2 - 14*5*3 - 13*5*2 - 10*3*2 + 5*3*2.

Calculate each term:

14*13*5 = 910

14*10*3 = 420

13*10*2 = 260

Sum: 910 + 420 + 260 = 1590

Subtract:

14*5*3 = 210

13*5*2 = 130

10*3*2 = 60

Total subtract: 210 + 130 + 60 = 400

Add back: 5*3*2 = 30

Total volume: 1590 - 400 + 30 = 1220 cm³. Which is higher than 1100.

Another example: a=3, b=3, c=4.

Volume = 14*13*3 + 14*10*3 + 13*10*4 - 14*3*3 - 13*3*4 - 10*3*4 + 3*3*4.

Calculate:

14*13*3 = 546

14*10*3 = 420

13*10*4 = 520

Sum: 546 + 420 + 520 = 1486

Subtract:

14*3*3 = 126

13*3*4 = 156

10*3*4 = 120

Total subtract: 126 + 156 + 120 = 402

Add back: 3*3*4 = 36

Total volume: 1486 - 402 + 36 = 1120 cm³.

Still higher than 1100.

Now, try a=0, b=5, c=5: volume 1100.

Try a=0, b=6, c=4:

Volume = 14*13*0 + 14*10*6 + 1

</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the geometric structure of an **equiangular hexagon**, where all internal angles are equal to $120^\circ$, but the side lengths can vary. The key insight is that such a hexagon can be modeled using **vector addition** in the plane, where the sum of the six side vectors must equal zero for the shape to close.

---

### Step 1: Assigning Directions to the Sides

We assume the first side lies along the positive x-axis (i.e., angle $0^\circ$), and each subsequent side is rotated **60° counterclockwise** from the previous one. This is because the external angle of an equiangular hexagon is $60^\circ$ (since internal angle is $120^\circ$, and $180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$).

Thus, the directions of the six sides are:
- Side 1: $0^\circ$
- Side 2: $60^\circ$
- Side 3: $120^\circ$
- Side 4: $180^\circ$
- Side 5: $240^\circ$
- Side 6: $300^\circ$

Let the lengths of the sides be:
- $a_1 = 1$
- $a_2 = 7$
- $a_3 = 2$
- $a_4 = 4$
- $a_5 = x$
- $a_6 = y$

---

### Step 2: Vector Representation

Each side can be represented as a vector with magnitude equal to its length and direction given by the angle above. The sum of all six vectors must be zero for the hexagon to be closed:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{6} \vec{v}_i = 0
$$

We compute the **x-components** and **y-components** of the vectors:

#### X-Components:
$$
x = a_1\cos(0^\circ) + a_2\cos(60^\circ) + a_3\cos(120^\circ) + a_4\cos(180^\circ) + a_5\cos(240^\circ) + a_6\cos(300^\circ)
$$

$$
x = 1 \cdot 1 + 7 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 4 \cdot (-1) + x \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + y \cdot \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
x = 1 + 3.5 - 1 - 4 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{2} = -0.5 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{2}
$$

Setting this equal to zero:

$$
-0.5 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{2} = 0 \Rightarrow y - x = 1 \tag{1}
$$

#### Y-Components:
$$
y = a_1\sin(0^\circ) + a_2\sin(60^\circ) + a_3\sin(120^\circ) + a_4\sin(180^\circ) + a_5\sin(240^\circ) + a_6\sin(300^\circ)
$$

$$
y = 0 + 7 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 0 + x \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + y \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
$$

$$
y = \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2} + \sqrt{3} - \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{y\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

$$
y = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(x + y)
$$

Setting this equal to zero:

$$
\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(x + y) = 0 \Rightarrow x + y = 9 \tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solving the System

From equations (1) and (2):

- $ y = x + 1 $
- $ x + y = 9 $

Substitute $ y = x + 1 $ into $ x + y = 9 $:

$$
x + (x + 1) = 9 \Rightarrow 2x + 1 = 9 \Rightarrow x = 4
$$

$$
y = x + 1 = 5
$$

So, the two remaining side lengths are $ x = 4 $ and $ y = 5 $, and their **sum is**:

$$
x + y = 4 + 5 = \boxed{9}
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{9}
