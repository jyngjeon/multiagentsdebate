Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 8. Extracted: {"answer": 6.9}

To explain:

Given that the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, we can write the relationship as \(E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}\), or \(E = k / \lambda\) for some constant \(k\).

If the original red light photon has an energy \(E_1\) and a wavelength \(\lambda_1 = 7 \times 10^{-7}\) meters, then a photon with 2000 times the energy, \(E_2 = 2000 E_1\), will have a wavelength \(\lambda_2\). Using the inverse proportionality relationship:

\[E_2 = \frac{k}{\lambda_2} = 2000 \cdot \frac{k}{\lambda_1}\]

Solving for \(\lambda_2\):

\[\lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{2000} = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2000} = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 10^3} = \frac{7}{2} \times 10^{-10} = 3.5 \times 10^{-10}\]

Thus, the wavelength of the photon with 2000 times the energy is \(3.5 \times 10^{-10}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {"answer": -4}

To solve this problem, let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. **Given Conditions**:
   - \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) are not real.
   - Recurrence relation: \( z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n \).
   - Real condition: \( \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} \) is real for all \( n \geq 1 \).
   - Magnitude condition: \( \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \).

2. **Magnitude Condition Analysis**:
   From the magnitude condition, we have:
   \[
   \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   |z_3| = 2|z_4| \quad \text{and} \quad |z_4| = 2|z_5|.
   \]
   Combining these, we get:
   \[
   |z_3| = 4|z_5|.
   \]

3. **Recurrence Relation Analysis**:
   Using the recurrence relation \( z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n \), we can express the terms as follows:
   \[
   z_3 = z_2^2 z_1,
   \]
   \[
   z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^4 z_1^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2,
   \]
   \[
   z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{10} z_1^4 z_2^2 z_1 = z_2^{12} z_1^5.
   \]

4. **Magnitude Calculation**:
   Using the magnitudes from the recurrence relations:
   \[
   |z_3| = |z_2|^2 |z_1|,
   \]
   \[
   |z_4| = |z_2|^5 |z_1|^2,
   \]
   \[
   |z_5| = |z_2|^{12} |z_1|^5.
   \]
   From the magnitude condition \( |z_3| = 4|z_5| \):
   \[
   |z_2|^2 |z_1| = 4 |z_2|^{12} |z_1|^5.
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   |z_2|^2 |z_1| = 4 |z_2|^{12} |z_1|^5,
   \]
   \[
   |z_2|^{10} |z_1|^4 = \frac{1}{4},
   \]
   \[
   |z_2|^{10} |z_1|^4 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2,
   \]
   \[
   (|z_2|^5 |z_1|^2)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2,
   \]
   \[
   |z_2|^5 |z_1|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

5. **Real Condition Analysis**:
   Given that \( \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} \) is real, we use the expression for \( z_3, z_4, z_5 \):
   \[
   \frac{z_3}{z_1^2} = \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_1^2} = z_2^2,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{z_4}{z_2^2} = \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^2} = z_2^3 z_1^2,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{z_5}{z_3^2} = \frac{z_2^{12} z_1^5}{(z_2^2 z_1)^2} = \frac{z_2^{12} z_1^5}{z_2^4 z_1^2} = z_2^8 z_1^3.
   \]
   Since \( z_2^2 \) is real, we conclude \( z_2 \) must be purely imaginary or real, but since \( z_2 \) is not real, it must be purely imaginary. Let \( z_2 = ai \) where \( a \in \mathbb{R} \).

6. **Solving for \( z_1 \)**:
   Using \( |z_2|^5 |z_1|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[
   |ai|^5 |z_1|^2 = \frac{1}{2},
   \]
   \[
   a^5 |z_1|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]
   Since \( z_2 = ai \), \( |z_2| = |a| \). Therefore:
   \[
   a^5 |z_1|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]
   Solving for \( |z_1|^2 \):
   \[
   |z_1|^2 = \frac{1}{2a^5}.
   \]
   Possible values of \( z_1 \) are:
   \[
   z_1 = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2a^5}} e^{i\theta}.
   \]
   Summing over all possible values:
   \[
   \text{Product of all possible values of } z_1 = -4.
   \]

Thus, the product of all possible values of \( z_1 \) is \(\boxed{-4}

  "reasoning": "From the graph, we can see that the center of the ellipse is at $(1, -2)$, which means $h=1$ and $k=-2$. We also observe that the semi-major axis (the longest radius) appears to be along the horizontal direction and its length is $2/3$ units on each side from the center, so $a = 2/3 \\times 2 = 4/3$.

  "reasoning": "To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( \\binom{10^9}{k} < \\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} \\), we start by writing out the binomial coefficients in terms of factorials:\n\\[
\\binom{10^9}{k} = \\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9 - k)!}
\\]\nand\n\\[
\\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \\frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k - 1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}.
\\]\nWe need to find when\n\\[
\\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \\frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k - 1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}.
\\]\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get\n\\[
\\frac{(10^9 + 1)(10^9)!}{(k - 1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}.
\\]\nThis inequality becomes\n\\[
\\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \\frac{(10^9 + 1)(10^9)!}{(k - 1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!},
\\]\nor\n\\[
\\frac{1}{k(10^9 - k + 1)} < \\frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 + 2 - k}.
\\]\nSimplifying further,\n\\[
\\frac{1}{k(10^9 - k + 1)} < \\frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 + 2 - k}.
\\]\nCross-multiplying gives\n\\[
10^9 + 2 - k < k(10^9 - k + 1)(10^9 + 1).
\\]\nExpanding and simplifying,\n\\[
10^9 + 2 - k < k(10^{18} - 10^9k + 10^9 + 10^9 - k + 1),
\\]\nor\n\\[
10^9 + 2 - k < k(10^{18} - 10^9k + 2 \\cdot 10^9 - k + 1).
\\]\nSince \( k \\) is small compared to \( 10^9 \\), we approximate and simplify to\n\\[
10^9 + 2 - k < k(10^{18} - 10^9k + 2 \\cdot 10^9).
\\]\nNeglecting higher order terms,\n\\[
10^9 + 2 - k < k(10^{18} + 2 \\cdot 10^9).
\\]\nThus, we solve\n\\[
10^9 + 2 - k < 2k \\cdot 10^9,
\\]\nor\n\\[
10^9 + 2 < 3k \\cdot 10^9.
\\]\nDividing both sides by \( 10^9 \\),\n\\[
1 + \\frac{2}{10^9} < 3k,
\\]\nor\n\\[
k > \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3 \\cdot 10^9}.
\\]\nSince \( k \\) must be an integer, the smallest \( k \\) satisfying this is \( k = 333333334 \\). The first two digits of \( k \\) are 3 and 3. Therefore, \( 10a + b = 10 \\cdot 3 + 3 = 33 \\).",
