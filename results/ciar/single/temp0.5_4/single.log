Raw response (cleaned): '{k-1} + something, but this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, notice that for any count k ≥ 0, the expected value E_k can be written as:

E_k = (1/6)*k + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_{k+1}.

Because:

- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1 and stop, contributing k.

- With probability 1/2, we roll even and reset to 0, contributing E.

- With probability 1/3, we roll 3 or 5, incrementing the count to k+1, contributing E_{k+1}.

But this leads to an infinite system of equations. However, maybe we can find a pattern or solve it recursively.

Assume that E_k = a * k + b, where a and b are constants. Let's see if this assumption holds.

Substitute into the equation:

a*k + b = (1/6)*k + (1/2)*(a*0 + b) + (1/3)*(a*(k+1) + b)

Simplify:

a*k + b = (1/6)k + (1/2)(b) + (1/3)(a*k + a + b)

Multiply out the right-hand side:

= (1/6)k + (b/2) + (a*k)/3 + (a)/3 + (b)/3

Combine like terms:

For k terms: (1/6 + a/3)k

For constants: b/2 + a/3 + b/3 = ( (3b + 2b)/6 ) + a/3 = (5b/6) + a/3

So the equation becomes:

a*k + b = [ (1/6 + a/3)k ] + [5b/6 + a/3 ]

Now, equate coefficients for k and constants:

For k:

a = 1/6 + a/3

Multiply both sides by 6:

6a = 1 + 2a → 4a = 1 → a = 1/4

For constants:

b = 5b/6 + a/3

Substitute a = 1/4:

b = 5b/6 + (1/4)/3 = 5b/6 + 1/12

Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:

12b = 10b + 1 → 2b = 1 → b = 1/2

Therefore, E_k = (1/4)k + 1/2.

But we need E_0, which is the expected value starting from count 0. So E_0 = (1/4)*0 + 1/2 = 1/2. Wait, but earlier with the other approach, I got E = 2. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?

Wait, this suggests that the expected value is 1/2, but the previous approach gave 2. Clearly, there's a mistake somewhere. Let me check.

In the first approach, I considered the expected number of cycles as 4, and expected count per cycle as 1/2, giving 4 * 1/2 = 2. In the second approach, using recursion, I found E_0 = 1/2. These results are conflicting, so I need to find where the error is.

Let me check the second approach again. The assumption was that E_k = a*k + b. Let me verify the equations again.

For E_k:

E_k = (1/6)*k + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_{k+1}

But in the second approach, I assumed E_k = a*k + b. But E is E_0. So substituting E = E_0 = b (since E_0 = a*0 + b = b). Wait, in the earlier substitution, I used E as the value of E_0. So in the equation for E_k, the term (1/2)*E is (1/2)*E_0.

But when I derived the equation for E_k, I substituted E = E_0. However, in the equation for E_0, we have:

E_0 = (1/6)*0 + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_1

Which is E_0 = (1/2)*E_0 + (1/3)*E_1 → rearranged as E_0 - (1/2)E_0 = (1/3)E_1 → (1/2)E_0 = (1/3)E_1 → E_1 = (3/2)E_0.

Similarly, for E_1:

E_1 = (1/6)*1 + (1/2)*E_0 + (1/3)*E_2

But according to the assumption E_k = (1/4)k + 1/2, then E_1 = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. And E_0 = 1/2. Then (3/2)E_0 = (3/2)(1/2) = 3/4, which matches E_1 = 3/4. So that seems consistent.

Similarly, for E_2 = (1/4)*2 + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Then, using the equation for E_1:

E_1 = 1/6*1 + (1/2)*E_0 + (1/3)*E_2 → 3/4 = 1/6 + (1/2)(1/2) + (1/3)(1) → 1/6 + 1/4 + 1/3 = (2/12 + 3/12 + 4/12) = 9/12 = 3/4. Correct.

So the assumption seems valid. Therefore, E_0 = 1/2. But this contradicts the earlier approach where I got 2. Where is the mistake?

Let me re-examine the first approach. I considered that each cycle contributes an expected count of 1/2, and the number of cycles is 4, leading to 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the second approach, the expected value is 1/2. These results are different, so one of the approaches is wrong.

Let me think about the first approach again. The first approach considered that each cycle contributes an expected count of 1/2, and the number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4, leading to expected number of cycles 4, hence total expected count 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the second approach, the expected count is 1/2. Which is correct?

Let me take a simple case. Suppose we have a very high probability of ending the cycle with a 1. For example, if p = 1, then the expected number of cycles is 1, and the expected count per cycle is m = 0 (since the cycle ends immediately). So total expected count is 0. According to the second approach, E_0 = 1/2 * 0 + 1/2 = 1/2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in this hypothetical scenario, the parameters would change. So maybe the first approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, let's take a concrete example. Let's simulate the process with the second approach's result of E_0 = 1/2.

If the expected value is 1/2, that means on average, the final count is 0.5. Let's see if that makes sense.

Consider the possible scenarios:

- First roll is 1: count is 0. Probability 1/6.

- First roll is even: reset to 0, then continue. The expected value from here is E_0 = 1/2. So contribution is (1/2)*E_0 = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

- First roll is 3 or 5: count becomes 1, and then the expected value from there is E_1 = 3/4. So contribution is (1/3)*3/4 = 1/4.

Total E_0 = 0 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. This matches the calculation. So according to this, the expected value is 1/2.

But in the first approach, I thought that the expected number of cycles is 4, and each contributes 1/2, giving 2. But this seems to contradict the recursive approach. Where is the error?

Ah! I think the mistake in the first approach is that the expected number of cycles is not 4. Let me re-examine that.

In the first approach, I considered that each cycle has a probability p = 1/4 of ending with a 1, and 3/4 of ending with an even. So the number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4. The expected number of cycles is 1/p = 4. But each cycle contributes an expected count of 1/2. So total expected count would be 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the recursive approach, it's 1/2. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the first approach is counting the expected number of counts across all cycles, but in reality, when a cycle ends with a 1, the count from that cycle is included, whereas in the recursive approach, the count is the final count when the process stops.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the first approach, the expected number of counts is the sum over all cycles of the counts from each cycle. Each cycle, whether it ends with a 1 or even, contributes its count. But in the recursive approach, the expected count is the count when the process stops, which is the count from the last cycle (which ends with a 1) plus the counts from all previous cycles (which ended with even). Therefore, the total expected count should be the same as the first approach's calculation. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, in the first approach, I calculated the expected number of counts per cycle as 1/2, and the expected number of cycles as 4, leading to 2. But according to the recursive approach, it's 1/2. This suggests that one of the calculations is wrong.

Let me check the first approach again. The number of counts per cycle is the number of 3s or 5s rolled before getting a 1 or even. The expected number of such counts is 1/2. The number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4 (probability of ending with a 1). The expected number of cycles is 4. So the total expected count would be 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the recursive approach, it's 1/2. This is a contradiction.

Let me take a concrete example. Suppose we have a very high probability of ending with a 1, say p = 1/2. Then, the expected number of cycles would be 2. The expected counts per cycle is (1-p)/p = (1 - 1/2)/ (1/2) = 1. So total expected count would be 2 * 1 = 2. But according to the recursive approach, let's compute E_0.

Using the recursive approach, with p = 1/2 (probability of ending with 1 in a cycle). Wait, but in the recursive approach, the parameters are different. Let me adjust the parameters for this hypothetical scenario.

Wait, this might not be straightforward. Let me instead consider a simpler case where the die is modified to have only two outcomes: 1 and 2, with equal probability. Then, if you roll a 1, you stop; if you roll a 2 (even), you reset. What is the expected count?

Using the recursive approach: E_0 = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*E_0 + ...? Wait, no. Let me define it properly.

In this case, when you roll a 1 (prob 1/2), you stop with count 0. When you roll a 2 (prob 1/2), you reset to 0 and continue. So the equation is E = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*E → E = 0 + (1/2)E → E = 0. Which makes sense because every time you roll a 2, you reset, and the only way to stop is with count 0.

But according to the first approach: each cycle has probability p = 1/2 of ending with 1. Expected number of cycles is 2. Expected count per cycle is (1-p)/p = (1-1/2)/(1/2) = 1. Total expected count is 2 * 1 = 2. But this contradicts the recursive approach which gives 0. Clearly, the first approach is wrong here.

So the first approach must be incorrect. Therefore, the error is in the first approach's assumption that the total expected count is the number of cycles multiplied by the expected count per cycle. This must be wrong.

So the recursive approach is correct, giving E_0 = 1/2 in the original problem. Therefore, the correct answer'

Question: We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one. What is the expected number of final counts?
Model Raw Answer: <think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this dice problem. So, the question is about rolling a die and counting the number of times we roll. The rules are: if we get an even number, we reset the count to zero. We stop when we roll a 1. We need to find the expected number of final counts. Hmm, I need to calculate the expected value here.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We start with a count of zero. Each time we roll the die, if it's even (2, 4, or 6), we reset the count to zero. If it's odd (1, 3, 5), we increment the count by one. But we stop when we roll a 1. Wait, no—if we roll a 1, we stop. So if we roll a 1, the process stops, and the final count is whatever it was before that roll. But if we roll an even number, we reset the count to zero. If we roll an odd number that's not 1 (so 3 or 5), we add 1 to the count. Then we continue rolling until we get a 1.

So the expected number of final counts is the expected value of the count when the process stops. Let me think about how to model this.

Let me denote E as the expected number of final counts. Let's consider the first roll. There are six possible outcomes, each with probability 1/6.

Case 1: Roll a 1 (probability 1/6). Then the process stops immediately, and the count is 0. So the contribution to E from this case is (1/6)*0 = 0.

Case 2: Roll an even number (2, 4, 6) (probability 3/6 = 1/2). Then the count resets to 0. But then we have to continue rolling. However, after resetting, the process is the same as starting over, but with a count of 0. Wait, but the count is reset, so the next rolls will again be subject to the same rules. However, the count is now 0, but we need to consider the expected value from that point. Wait, but when you reset to 0, the count is 0, but then you have to keep rolling. So maybe the expected value after a reset is the same as the original expected value? Or is there a difference?

Wait, actually, the count is reset to zero, but the process continues. So if we reset the count, the next rolls will again be subject to the same rules. However, the count is now zero, but the next rolls could again lead to resets or increments. Therefore, the expected value after a reset would be the same as the original expected value. Wait, but the count is zero, but the process continues. However, the count is not being added to yet. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the count is reset to zero when we roll an even number. So if we roll an even number, we reset the count to zero, and then continue rolling. So the count is now zero, but we have to continue. So the expected value from that point on would be the same as the original expected value E. Because regardless of the current count, the process is memoryless in terms of the expected value. Wait, but the count is zero, but the process continues. So the expected number of final counts would be the same as starting over, but with a count of zero. Wait, but when you start over, the count is zero. So maybe the expected value E is the same in both cases. Therefore, if we roll an even number, we reset the count to zero, and then the expected value from that point is E. But wait, no. Because the count is zero, but we need to consider that the count will be incremented if we roll odd numbers (other than 1) before rolling a 1. So perhaps the expected value after a reset is the same as E. Therefore, the contribution from rolling an even number is (1/2)*E. Wait, but that seems recursive.

Case 3: Roll an odd number that's not 1 (i.e., 3 or 5) (probability 2/6 = 1/3). Then we increment the count by 1. Then we continue rolling. However, the count is now 1, and we need to continue. But again, the process is the same as before, except that the count is now 1. Wait, but the expected value would depend on the current count. So maybe I need to define E as the expected number of final counts starting from a count of 0. Then, if we are in a state where the count is k, then the expected value would be different. But this seems complicated. However, maybe there's a way to model this with states.

Alternatively, perhaps the count is not important in the expectation. Wait, but the count is being incremented each time we roll an odd number (not 1), and reset when we roll an even. So the final count is the number of consecutive odd numbers (excluding 1) rolled before getting a 1 or an even number. Wait, but when you roll an even number, you reset the count. So the process is like: each time you have a streak of odd numbers (excluding 1), and each time you hit an even, you start over. But the final count is the count when you hit a 1.

Wait, maybe I can model this as follows: each trial consists of a sequence of rolls until we get either a 1 or an even number. If we get a 1, the process stops and the count is the number of odd numbers (excluding 1) rolled in that trial. If we get an even number, the count resets to zero, and we start a new trial. However, the problem says we stop when we get a 1. So the process continues until we get a 1. Therefore, each time we have a sequence of rolls where we get odd numbers (3 or 5) and then either hit a 1 or an even. If we hit a 1, we stop. If we hit an even, we reset the count and continue.

So the expected value E can be thought of as the expected number of odd numbers (excluding 1) that occur before the first occurrence of a 1 or an even number. Wait, but when you reset, you start over. So the process is like a series of trials, each trial being a sequence of rolls until either a 1 or an even is rolled. Each trial contributes a certain number of counts (the number of 3s and 5s rolled in that trial), and then if the trial ends with an even, you start a new trial. If the trial ends with a 1, the process stops, and the total count is the sum of counts from all trials before that.

But since the trials are independent, maybe we can model this as a geometric distribution. Wait, but the count is the sum over multiple trials. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's consider that each time we are in a state where we can roll the die. Let me define E as the expected number of final counts. When we start, the count is 0. When we roll the die:

- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1: the process stops, and the count is 0. So contribution is 0.

- With probability 1/2 (rolling 2,4,6), we reset the count to 0 and continue. So the expected value from here is E (since we reset and start over). So contribution is (1/2)*E.

- With probability 1/3 (rolling 3 or 5), we increment the count by 1 and continue. But now, after incrementing, we are in a state where the count is 1, and we need to continue. Wait, but how does that affect the expectation? Because the count is now 1, but the process continues. However, the problem is that the count is being tracked, and each time you increment, you add to the count. But when you reset, you go back to zero. So maybe the expectation depends on the current count. Therefore, perhaps we need to define E as the expected value starting from a count of 0, and define another variable, say E_k, as the expected value starting from a count of k. But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express E in terms of itself. Let's think recursively. Suppose we are in the initial state (count = 0). Then, as before:

E = (1/6)*0 + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*(1 + E') 

Wait, what's E' here? If we roll a 3 or 5, we increment the count by 1, and then continue. But after that increment, the count is 1, and we need to continue. However, the process from that point is similar to the original problem, but with the count starting at 1. Wait, but how does that affect the expectation? Because the count is now 1, but the process continues. However, the problem is that the count is being accumulated, and if we get an even number, it resets to 0. So maybe the expectation when starting with a count of k is different.

This seems complex. Let me try to define E as the expected number of final counts starting from a count of 0. Let me also define E_k as the expected number of final counts starting from a count of k. However, since the count resets to 0 when an even is rolled, maybe the count is not important in the expectation. Wait, no. Because if you have a count of k, and then you roll an odd number, you add 1 to the count. But if you roll an even, you reset to 0. So the count is part of the state.

Alternatively, maybe the count is not important because when you reset, you start over. However, the count is the number of times you've added 1 before getting a 1 or an even. So perhaps the expected value can be modeled as follows:

Each time you roll the die, there's a chance to end the process (rolling a 1) or reset (rolling even) or continue (rolling 3 or 5). Let me think of the expected number of increments before a 1 is rolled, considering that resets can happen.

Alternatively, think of the process as a Markov chain with states representing the current count. But this might be too involved.

Wait, here's another approach. Let me consider that each time we have a "cycle" of rolls until we either get a 1 or an even number. The number of counts added during this cycle is the number of times we rolled 3 or 5 before getting a 1 or an even. Then, if we got an even, we start a new cycle. If we got a 1, the process stops.

So, the total expected count is the sum over all cycles of the counts from each cycle, where each cycle contributes a count only if it didn't end with a 1. However, since the process stops when we get a 1, the total expected count is the expected sum of counts from all cycles before the first cycle that ends with a 1.

This seems like a geometric distribution scenario. Let me formalize this.

Let me define the expected number of counts as E. Each cycle has a certain probability of ending with a 1, in which case the process stops, or ending with an even, in which case we have to continue.

First, let's compute the probability that a single cycle ends with a 1, and the expected number of counts added in a cycle.

In a single cycle, we roll the die until we get either a 1 or an even number. Let's compute the probability that the cycle ends with a 1, and the expected number of counts (i.e., number of 3s or 5s) in that cycle.

Let me denote p as the probability of ending the cycle with a 1, and q as the probability of ending with an even. Then, the expected number of counts in a cycle is some value, say m.

Then, the total expected count E is the expected number of counts from all cycles before the first cycle that ends with a 1. Since each cycle is independent, this would be a geometric distribution with success probability p (where "success" means the cycle ends with a 1), and the expected number of cycles is 1/p. But each cycle contributes m counts on average, except the last one which doesn't contribute anything because the process stops. Wait, no. Wait, each cycle that ends with an even contributes m counts, and the cycle that ends with a 1 contributes m counts as well? No, wait. If the cycle ends with a 1, then the count is the number of 3s or 5s rolled in that cycle. So the total expected count would be the expected number of cycles that end with an even multiplied by their expected count, plus the expected count from the cycle that ends with a 1.

But since the process stops when a cycle ends with a 1, the number of cycles is a geometric random variable with probability p, where each trial is a cycle. The expected number of cycles is 1/p. However, each cycle (except possibly the last one) ends with an even, and contributes m counts. The last cycle ends with a 1 and contributes m counts as well. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of counts is the sum over all cycles of the counts in each cycle. Each cycle, regardless of whether it ends with 1 or even, contributes some count. But the process stops when a cycle ends with 1. Therefore, the total expected count is the expected number of cycles multiplied by the expected count per cycle.

But since the number of cycles is geometric with parameter p, the expected number of cycles is 1/p. However, the expected count per cycle is m. Therefore, the total expected count E = (1/p) * m. Wait, but that might not be correct because in the last cycle, when we get a 1, the count is added. However, in the previous cycles, which ended with even, the counts were added as well. So yes, the total expected count would be the expected number of cycles multiplied by the expected count per cycle.

But let's verify this. Suppose each cycle has expected count m, and the number of cycles is a geometric random variable with parameter p (probability of ending with 1). Then, the total expected count is E = E[number of cycles] * E[count per cycle] = (1/p) * m.

But first, we need to compute p (probability that a cycle ends with a 1) and m (expected count per cycle).

Let me compute p and m. In a single cycle, we roll the die until we get either a 1 or an even number. Let's model this as a geometric distribution. Each trial, the probability of success (ending the cycle) is the probability of rolling a 1 or an even. Wait, no. Wait, in each roll, the cycle ends if we roll a 1 or an even. Otherwise, we continue.

So, in each roll, the probability that the cycle ends is the probability of rolling a 1 or an even. The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, even is 3/6 = 1/2. So total probability of ending the cycle is 1/6 + 1/2 = 2/3. The probability of continuing the cycle (rolling a 3 or 5) is 2/6 = 1/3.

Therefore, the number of rolls in a cycle follows a geometric distribution with success probability 2/3. However, the expected number of rolls in a cycle is 1/(2/3) = 3/2. But we need the expected number of counts (number of 3s or 5s) in the cycle. Each time we roll a 3 or 5, we add 1 to the count. So the number of counts is equal to the number of trials before the first success (where success is rolling a 1 or even). Since each trial that is not a success (i.e., rolling 3 or 5) contributes 1 to the count.

The number of counts in a cycle is the number of failures before the first success in a geometric distribution. For a geometric distribution with success probability p, the expected number of failures before the first success is (1-p)/p. Here, p is 2/3, so the expected number of counts is (1 - 2/3)/(2/3) = (1/3)/(2/3) = 1/2. So m = 1/2.

Wait, that seems right. Because the expected number of failures (which are 3 or 5) before the first success (1 or even) is 1/2.

Now, the probability that the cycle ends with a 1 is the probability that the first success is a 1. Given that the cycle ends with a success (either 1 or even), the probability that it was a 1 is (probability of 1) / (probability of success). The probability of success is 2/3, and the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6. So the conditional probability is (1/6) / (2/3) = (1/6) * (3/2) = 1/4.

Therefore, p = 1/4. Wait, but earlier I thought p was the probability that the cycle ends with a 1. But actually, in the context of the cycles, each cycle has a probability of ending with a 1 or an even. The probability that the cycle ends with a 1 is 1/4, and with an even is 3/4 (since 2/3 total success probability, and 1/6 / (2/3) = 1/4 for 1, and 3/6 / (2/3) = 1/2 / (2/3) = 3/4 for even? Wait, no. Wait, the probability that the cycle ends with a 1 is (probability of rolling a 1) divided by the total probability of ending the cycle. Wait, the cycle ends when you roll a 1 or even. So the probability that the cycle ends with a 1 is (probability of rolling a 1) divided by (probability of rolling a 1 or even). Which is (1/6) / (1/6 + 1/2) = (1/6) / (2/3) = 1/4. Similarly, the probability of ending with an even is (3/6) / (2/3) = 1/2 / (2/3) = 3/4.

Therefore, in each cycle, the probability of ending with a 1 is 1/4, and with an even is 3/4.

But earlier, I thought that the number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4. However, the number of cycles is determined by the number of times we get an even number before getting a 1. Each cycle is a trial where we have a 1/4 chance of ending with a 1 (and thus stopping) and 3/4 chance of ending with an even (and continuing). Therefore, the number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4. The expected number of cycles is 1/p = 4.

Then, the total expected count E = expected number of cycles * expected count per cycle = 4 * 1/2 = 2.

Wait, that seems like the answer is 2. But let me check this again.

So, according to this approach, the expected number of counts is 4 * 0.5 = 2. Is this correct?

Alternatively, let's think of it recursively. Let me define E as the expected number of final counts. When we start, we roll the die:

- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1: count is 0, so contribution is 0.

- With probability 1/2 (even), we reset to 0 and continue. So the expected value from here is E.

- With probability 1/3 (3 or 5), we increment the count by 1 and continue. But now, after incrementing, what is the expected value? Let's say after incrementing, we have a count of 1, but the process continues. However, the count is now 1, and we need to continue rolling. However, the count is reset to 0 if we roll an even, and incremented again if we roll another 3 or 5. So the expected value from this new state is the same as the original E, but with an added 1. Wait, no. Because the count is now 1, but the process continues. However, the count is being tracked, and the final count is the count when we stop. So if we have a count of k, and then we roll a 3 or 5, we add 1 to k, and continue. If we roll a 1, we stop with count k. If we roll even, reset to 0 and continue.

This seems to suggest that the expected value depends on the current count. Therefore, we need to define E as the expected value starting from count 0, and E_k as the expected value starting from count k. However, this might get complex, but maybe we can find a recursive relation.

Let me try this approach. Let E be the expected value starting from count 0. When we start, we roll the die:

- 1/6 chance to roll 1: count is 0, so contribution is 0.

- 1/2 chance to roll even: reset to 0, so contribution is E.

- 1/3 chance to roll 3 or 5: increment count to 1, and then the expected value from there is E_1.

So, E = (1/6)*0 + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_1.

Now, what is E_1? It's the expected value starting from count 1. When in this state, we roll the die:

- 1/6 chance to roll 1: the process stops, and the count is 1. So contribution is 1.

- 1/2 chance to roll even: reset to 0, so the expected value from there is E.

- 1/3 chance to roll 3 or 5: increment count to 2, and then the expected value from there is E_2.

So, E_1 = (1/6)*1 + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_2.

Similarly, for E_2:

E_2 = (1/6)*2 + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_3.

This seems to go on indefinitely. However, if we assume that E_k = E_{k-1} + something, but this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, notice that for any count k ≥ 0, the expected value E_k can be written as:

E_k = (1/6)*k + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_{k+1}.

Because:

- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1 and stop, contributing k.

- With probability 1/2, we roll even and reset to 0, contributing E.

- With probability 1/3, we roll 3 or 5, incrementing the count to k+1, contributing E_{k+1}.

But this leads to an infinite system of equations. However, maybe we can find a pattern or solve it recursively.

Assume that E_k = a * k + b, where a and b are constants. Let's see if this assumption holds.

Substitute into the equation:

a*k + b = (1/6)*k + (1/2)*(a*0 + b) + (1/3)*(a*(k+1) + b)

Simplify:

a*k + b = (1/6)k + (1/2)(b) + (1/3)(a*k + a + b)

Multiply out the right-hand side:

= (1/6)k + (b/2) + (a*k)/3 + (a)/3 + (b)/3

Combine like terms:

For k terms: (1/6 + a/3)k

For constants: b/2 + a/3 + b/3 = ( (3b + 2b)/6 ) + a/3 = (5b/6) + a/3

So the equation becomes:

a*k + b = [ (1/6 + a/3)k ] + [5b/6 + a/3 ]

Now, equate coefficients for k and constants:

For k:

a = 1/6 + a/3

Multiply both sides by 6:

6a = 1 + 2a → 4a = 1 → a = 1/4

For constants:

b = 5b/6 + a/3

Substitute a = 1/4:

b = 5b/6 + (1/4)/3 = 5b/6 + 1/12

Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:

12b = 10b + 1 → 2b = 1 → b = 1/2

Therefore, E_k = (1/4)k + 1/2.

But we need E_0, which is the expected value starting from count 0. So E_0 = (1/4)*0 + 1/2 = 1/2. Wait, but earlier with the other approach, I got E = 2. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?

Wait, this suggests that the expected value is 1/2, but the previous approach gave 2. Clearly, there's a mistake somewhere. Let me check.

In the first approach, I considered the expected number of cycles as 4, and expected count per cycle as 1/2, giving 4 * 1/2 = 2. In the second approach, using recursion, I found E_0 = 1/2. These results are conflicting, so I need to find where the error is.

Let me check the second approach again. The assumption was that E_k = a*k + b. Let me verify the equations again.

For E_k:

E_k = (1/6)*k + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_{k+1}

But in the second approach, I assumed E_k = a*k + b. But E is E_0. So substituting E = E_0 = b (since E_0 = a*0 + b = b). Wait, in the earlier substitution, I used E as the value of E_0. So in the equation for E_k, the term (1/2)*E is (1/2)*E_0.

But when I derived the equation for E_k, I substituted E = E_0. However, in the equation for E_0, we have:

E_0 = (1/6)*0 + (1/2)*E + (1/3)*E_1

Which is E_0 = (1/2)*E_0 + (1/3)*E_1 → rearranged as E_0 - (1/2)E_0 = (1/3)E_1 → (1/2)E_0 = (1/3)E_1 → E_1 = (3/2)E_0.

Similarly, for E_1:

E_1 = (1/6)*1 + (1/2)*E_0 + (1/3)*E_2

But according to the assumption E_k = (1/4)k + 1/2, then E_1 = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. And E_0 = 1/2. Then (3/2)E_0 = (3/2)(1/2) = 3/4, which matches E_1 = 3/4. So that seems consistent.

Similarly, for E_2 = (1/4)*2 + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Then, using the equation for E_1:

E_1 = 1/6*1 + (1/2)*E_0 + (1/3)*E_2 → 3/4 = 1/6 + (1/2)(1/2) + (1/3)(1) → 1/6 + 1/4 + 1/3 = (2/12 + 3/12 + 4/12) = 9/12 = 3/4. Correct.

So the assumption seems valid. Therefore, E_0 = 1/2. But this contradicts the earlier approach where I got 2. Where is the mistake?

Let me re-examine the first approach. I considered that each cycle contributes an expected count of 1/2, and the number of cycles is 4, leading to 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the second approach, the expected value is 1/2. These results are different, so one of the approaches is wrong.

Let me think about the first approach again. The first approach considered that each cycle contributes an expected count of 1/2, and the number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4, leading to expected number of cycles 4, hence total expected count 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the second approach, the expected count is 1/2. Which is correct?

Let me take a simple case. Suppose we have a very high probability of ending the cycle with a 1. For example, if p = 1, then the expected number of cycles is 1, and the expected count per cycle is m = 0 (since the cycle ends immediately). So total expected count is 0. According to the second approach, E_0 = 1/2 * 0 + 1/2 = 1/2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in this hypothetical scenario, the parameters would change. So maybe the first approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, let's take a concrete example. Let's simulate the process with the second approach's result of E_0 = 1/2.

If the expected value is 1/2, that means on average, the final count is 0.5. Let's see if that makes sense.

Consider the possible scenarios:

- First roll is 1: count is 0. Probability 1/6.

- First roll is even: reset to 0, then continue. The expected value from here is E_0 = 1/2. So contribution is (1/2)*E_0 = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

- First roll is 3 or 5: count becomes 1, and then the expected value from there is E_1 = 3/4. So contribution is (1/3)*3/4 = 1/4.

Total E_0 = 0 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. This matches the calculation. So according to this, the expected value is 1/2.

But in the first approach, I thought that the expected number of cycles is 4, and each contributes 1/2, giving 2. But this seems to contradict the recursive approach. Where is the error?

Ah! I think the mistake in the first approach is that the expected number of cycles is not 4. Let me re-examine that.

In the first approach, I considered that each cycle has a probability p = 1/4 of ending with a 1, and 3/4 of ending with an even. So the number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4. The expected number of cycles is 1/p = 4. But each cycle contributes an expected count of 1/2. So total expected count would be 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the recursive approach, it's 1/2. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the first approach is counting the expected number of counts across all cycles, but in reality, when a cycle ends with a 1, the count from that cycle is included, whereas in the recursive approach, the count is the final count when the process stops.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the first approach, the expected number of counts is the sum over all cycles of the counts from each cycle. Each cycle, whether it ends with a 1 or even, contributes its count. But in the recursive approach, the expected count is the count when the process stops, which is the count from the last cycle (which ends with a 1) plus the counts from all previous cycles (which ended with even). Therefore, the total expected count should be the same as the first approach's calculation. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, in the first approach, I calculated the expected number of counts per cycle as 1/2, and the expected number of cycles as 4, leading to 2. But according to the recursive approach, it's 1/2. This suggests that one of the calculations is wrong.

Let me check the first approach again. The number of counts per cycle is the number of 3s or 5s rolled before getting a 1 or even. The expected number of such counts is 1/2. The number of cycles is geometric with parameter p = 1/4 (probability of ending with a 1). The expected number of cycles is 4. So the total expected count would be 4 * 1/2 = 2. But according to the recursive approach, it's 1/2. This is a contradiction.

Let me take a concrete example. Suppose we have a very high probability of ending with a 1, say p = 1/2. Then, the expected number of cycles would be 2. The expected counts per cycle is (1-p)/p = (1 - 1/2)/ (1/2) = 1. So total expected count would be 2 * 1 = 2. But according to the recursive approach, let's compute E_0.

Using the recursive approach, with p = 1/2 (probability of ending with 1 in a cycle). Wait, but in the recursive approach, the parameters are different. Let me adjust the parameters for this hypothetical scenario.

Wait, this might not be straightforward. Let me instead consider a simpler case where the die is modified to have only two outcomes: 1 and 2, with equal probability. Then, if you roll a 1, you stop; if you roll a 2 (even), you reset. What is the expected count?

Using the recursive approach: E_0 = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*E_0 + ...? Wait, no. Let me define it properly.

In this case, when you roll a 1 (prob 1/2), you stop with count 0. When you roll a 2 (prob 1/2), you reset to 0 and continue. So the equation is E = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*E → E = 0 + (1/2)E → E = 0. Which makes sense because every time you roll a 2, you reset, and the only way to stop is with count 0.

But according to the first approach: each cycle has probability p = 1/2 of ending with 1. Expected number of cycles is 2. Expected count per cycle is (1-p)/p = (1-1/2)/(1/2) = 1. Total expected count is 2 * 1 = 2. But this contradicts the recursive approach which gives 0. Clearly, the first approach is wrong here.

So the first approach must be incorrect. Therefore, the error is in the first approach's assumption that the total expected count is the number of cycles multiplied by the expected count per cycle. This must be wrong.

So the recursive approach is correct, giving E_0 = 1/2 in the original problem. Therefore, the correct answer

Raw response (cleaned): '{n-1}a. The total work after n days is a*(2^n - 1). So if the total task is T, then T = a*(2^20 - 1). But we need to find when he completed 25% of the task, which is T/4.

So, the total work done up to day k is a*(2^k - 1). We need this to be equal to T/4. Since T = a*(2^20 - 1), substituting:

a*(2^k - 1) = (a*(2^20 - 1))/4

Divide both sides by a:

2^k - 1 = (2^20 - 1)/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4*(2^k - 1) = 2^20 - 1

Expand left side:

4*2^k - 4 = 2^20 - 1

Rearrange:

4*2^k = 2^20 - 1 + 4

Which is:

4*2^k = 2^20 + 3

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the task is completed on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task. That is, the work done on day 20 is equal to the total task. In that case, the total task T = work done on day 20 = 2^{19}a (assuming day 1 is a). Then, the total work done up to day k is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i a = a*(2^k - 1). But if T = 2^{19}a, then:

a*(2^k - 1) = 25% of T = 0.25 * 2^{19}a

Divide both sides by a:

2^k - 1 = 0.25 * 2^{19}

Simplify the right side:

0.25 is 1/4, so 2^{19}/4 = 2^{19}/2^2 = 2^{17}

So:

2^k - 1 = 2^{17}

Then 2^k = 2^{17} + 1

But 2^{17} + 1 is not a power of two, so this seems problematic. Therefore, this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the man doubles the amount of work he does each day, and on day 20, he completes the task. So the work done on day 20 is equal to the total task. Then, the total work done up to day 20 is the sum of all previous days' work plus day 20's work. But if the total task is done on day 20, then the sum of all work up to day 20 is the total task. However, that would mean that the work done on day 20 is the same as the sum of all previous days. Because each day's work is double the previous day's. So, let's think:

Let’s say the work done on day 1 is x. Then day 2: 2x, day 3: 4x, ..., day 20: 2^{19}x.

The total work done up to day 20 is x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^{19}x = x*(2^{20} - 1). But the problem states that he completes the task in 20 days, so the total work T = x*(2^{20} - 1).

Now, we need to find the day when he completed 25% of the task, which is T/4 = x*(2^{20} - 1)/4.

Let’s find the smallest k such that the sum of work up to day k is ≥ T/4.

The sum up to day k is x*(2^k - 1). So:

x*(2^k - 1) ≥ x*(2^{20} - 1)/4

Divide both sides by x:

2^k - 1 ≥ (2^{20} - 1)/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4*(2^k - 1) ≥ 2^{20} - 1

Which simplifies to:

4*2^k - 4 ≥ 2^{20} - 1

Then:

4*2^k ≥ 2^{20} + 3

But 4 is 2^2, so:

2^2 * 2^k ≥ 2^{20} + 3

Which is:

2^{k+2} ≥ 2^{20} + 3

Since 2^{20} is much larger than 3, we can approximate 2^{k+2} ≈ 2^{20}, so k+2 ≈ 20 → k ≈ 18. So k=18.

Let’s check for k=18:

Left side: 4*(2^18 - 1) = 4*2^18 - 4 = 2^2*2^18 - 4 = 2^20 - 4

Right side: 2^20 - 1

So 2^20 - 4 ≥ 2^20 - 1? No, that's not true. 2^20 -4 is less than 2^20 -1. So the inequality doesn't hold for k=18.

Wait, but we need 4*(2^k -1) ≥ 2^20 -1.

So for k=18:

Left: 4*(2^18 -1) = 4*2^18 -4 = 2^20 -4

Which is 2^20 -4. Compare to right side 2^20 -1. So 2^20 -4 is less than 2^20 -1. So not enough.

For k=19:

Left: 4*(2^19 -1) = 4*2^19 -4 = 2^21 -4

Compare to 2^20 -1. 2^21 is 2*2^20, so 2^21 -4 is way larger than 2^20 -1. So the inequality holds for k=19.

But we need the smallest k where the sum up to day k is at least 25% of T. Since for k=18, the sum is 2^20 -4, and T is 2^20 -1. So 25% of T is (2^20 -1)/4. Let's compute the sum up to day 18, which is 2^18 -1 multiplied by x, but since T = x*(2^20 -1), the sum up to day 18 is (2^18 -1)/ (2^20 -1) * T. Let's compute that fraction:

(2^18 -1)/(2^20 -1) = (2^18 -1)/( (2^20 -1)) = approximately (2^18)/(2^20) = 1/4. But since 2^20 -1 is slightly larger than 2^20, and 2^18 -1 is slightly less than 2^18, the actual value is slightly less than 1/4. So the sum up to day 18 is slightly less than 25% of T. Therefore, the 25% is achieved on day 19.

But this contradicts the initial thought that day 18 would be 25%. So which is correct?

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the work done on day 20 is the entire task, and the previous days' work is cumulative. Let me think again.

If the man completes the task on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he finishes the task. If he doubles the work each day, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the total work done up to day 19 plus the work done on day 20. But that might not be the case. Wait, if he doubles the work each day, then the work done on day 20 is twice the work done on day 19. So if the total work is done on day 20, then the work done on day 20 is the remaining part of the task. So the total task is the sum of all work done up to day 20. But this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try a different approach. Let's think in terms of the last day. If the task is completed on day 20, and each day he doubles the work, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the sum of all previous days' work. Because if he doubles the work each day, then the work on day 20 is twice the work on day 19, which would be equal to the total work done before day 20. So:

Let’s denote the work done on day 1 as W. Then day 2: 2W, day 3: 4W, ..., day 20: 2^{19}W.

The total work done before day 20 is the sum from day 1 to day 19: W*(2^{19} - 1). The work done on day 20 is 2^{19}W. So the total task T is the sum up to day 20: W*(2^{19} - 1) + 2^{19}W = W*(2^{19} - 1 + 2^{19}) = W*(2*2^{19} -1) = W*(2^{20} -1). But this seems similar to the earlier approach.

But if the task is completed on day 20, then the total work is T = W*(2^{20} -1). Now, to find when he completed 25% of the task, which is T/4 = W*(2^{20} -1)/4.

We need to find the smallest k such that the sum of work up to day k is ≥ T/4.

The sum up to day k is W*(2^k -1). So:

W*(2^k -1) ≥ W*(2^{20} -1)/4 → 2^k -1 ≥ (2^{20} -1)/4.

As before, solving this:

Multiply both sides by 4: 4*2^k -4 ≥ 2^{20} -1 → 4*2^k ≥ 2^{20} +3.

Since 2^{20} is much larger than 3, we can approximate 4*2^k ≈ 2^{20} → 2^{k+2} ≈ 2^{20} → k+2 = 20 → k=18.

But checking with exact values:

For k=18:

Left side: 4*(2^18 -1) = 4*2^18 -4 = 2^20 -4.

Right side: 2^20 -1.

So 2^20 -4 ≥ 2^20 -1? No, because -4 is less than -1. Therefore, the inequality is not satisfied for k=18.

For k=19:

Left side: 4*(2^19 -1) = 4*2^19 -4 = 2^21 -4.

Compare to right side: 2^20 -1. Since 2^21 is 2*2^20, 2^21 -4 is definitely greater than 2^20 -1. So the inequality holds for k=19.

Therefore, the smallest k where the sum up to day k is at least 25% of T is 19 days. But wait, this contradicts the earlier thought that day 18 would be 25%. What's the issue here?

Wait, the problem says "completely does the task in 20 days". So the total task is completed on day 20. So the sum up to day 20 is T. Now, we need to find when the sum up to day k is 25% of T. So, solving 2^k -1 = (2^20 -1)/4. Let me compute (2^20 -1)/4. Let's approximate 2^20 is 1,048,576. So (1,048,576 -1)/4 = 1,048,575 /4 = 262,143.75.

Now, 2^k -1 = 262,143.75. Solving for k:

2^k = 262,143.75 +1 = 262,144.75. Now, 2^18 is 262,144. So 2^18 = 262,144. So 2^k is approximately 262,144.75, which is just slightly more than 2^18. Therefore, k is slightly more than 18. But since k must be an integer, the sum up to day 18 is 2^18 -1 = 262,144 -1 = 262,143, which is just 0.75 less than 262,143.75. Therefore, the sum up to day 18 is slightly less than 25% of T, and the sum up to day 19 is 2^19 -1 = 524,287, which is much more than 262,143.75. Therefore, the 25% of the task is completed on day 19.

But wait, this seems to suggest that it's day 19. But earlier I thought day 18. Which is correct?

Let me check with actual numbers. Suppose T = 2^20 -1 = 1,048,575.

25% of T is 1,048,575 * 0.25 = 262,143.75.

Sum up to day 18: 2^18 -1 = 262,144 -1 = 262,143. Which is 0.75 less than 262,143.75. So on day 18, the sum is 262,143, which is just short of 25%. Then on day 19, he adds 2^18 = 262,144 units. So the total sum after day 19 is 262,143 + 262,144 = 524,287, which is more than 262,143.75. Therefore, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But the question asks "how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of the task?" If the task is completed during day 19, then it took 19 days to reach 25%. But the problem might be considering that the work is done in discrete days, and the 25% is achieved exactly on day 19. However, since the sum up to day 18 is just slightly less than 25%, and day 19's work brings it over, the answer would be 19 days.

But this contradicts the initial thought that day 18 would be 25%. Where is the mistake?

Ah, perhaps the problem is not about the cumulative work but about the work done on a particular day. For example, if the task is completed on day 20, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the total task. In that case, the work done on day 20 is 2^{19}W, and the total task T = 2^{19}W. Then, the work done on day k is 2^{k-1}W. We need to find when the work done on day k is 25% of T, which is 0.25 * 2^{19}W = 2^{17}W. Setting 2^{k-1}W = 2^{17}W → k-1 = 17 → k=18. So in this interpretation, the answer is 18 days.

This seems to be a different interpretation of the problem. The key is whether the task is completed on day 20 by doing the work on day 20 alone, or by accumulating work over 20 days.

The problem states: "the man completely does the task in 20 days". This could mean that after 20 days, the task is done, which would imply that the cumulative work over 20 days is the task. However, another interpretation is that he finishes the task on the 20th day, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the remaining part of the task.

This ambiguity is critical. Let's look at the exact wording: "he doubles the task done everyday. If the man completely does the task in 20 days, how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of the task?"

The phrase "completely does the task in 20 days" likely means that the entire task is done by the end of day 20, implying that the cumulative work up to day 20 is the total task. Therefore, the first interpretation where the sum of work over 20 days is T is correct. In that case, as calculated earlier, the 25% is achieved on day 19.

But this leads to a fractional day, which is not possible. However, since the work is done in discrete days, the 25% is achieved during day 19, so the answer is 19 days.

But this seems counterintuitive. Let's try with smaller numbers. Suppose the task is completed in 2 days. So total work is sum of day 1 and day 2. Let's say day 1: x, day 2: 2x. Total T = 3x. 25% of T is 0.75x. The sum after day 1 is x, which is more than 0.75x. So the 25% is achieved on day 1. But according to the formula, solving 2^k -1 = (2^2 -1)/4 → 2^k -1 = 3/4 → 2^k = 1.75 → k is between 0 and 1, which doesn't make sense. Wait, this shows the formula might not be applicable for small numbers. So perhaps the initial approach is flawed.

Alternatively, if the task is completed on day 2, meaning that the work done on day 2 is the total task. So T = 2x. Then, 25% of T is 0.5x. The work done on day 1 is x, which is 50% of T. So 25% would be achieved on day 1 if we consider the work done on day 1 is 50% of T, which is more than 25%. So this doesn't help.

This suggests that the interpretation is crucial. Given the problem's wording, the most logical interpretation is that the total work is completed on day 20, meaning that the cumulative work up to day 20 is the total task. In this case, the calculation shows that the 25% is achieved on day 19. However, the earlier example with day 2 shows inconsistency, which might be due to the small numbers.

Alternatively, let's think of the task as being completed on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he does the last part of the task. If the work doubles each day, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the sum of all work done before day 20. Because if he doubles the work each day, then day 20's work is twice day 19's work, which would be equal to the total work done before day 20. So:

Let’s denote the work on day 1 as W. Then day 2: 2W, day 3: 4W, ..., day 20: 2^{19}W.

Total work done before day 20: W + 2W + 4W + ... + 2^{18}W = W*(2^{19} - 1). Work done on day 20: 2^{19}W. Total task T = work before day 20 + work on day 20 = W*(2^{19} -1) + 2^{19}W = W*(2^{20} -1). So this is the same as before.

Now, to find when the cumulative work is 25% of T, which is 0.25 * W*(2^{20} -1).

The cumulative work up to day k is W*(2^k -1). Setting this equal to 0.25 * W*(2^{20} -1):

2^k -1 = 0.25*(2^{20} -1)

As before, solving this gives k ≈ 18. But since 2^18 -1 is slightly less than 0.25*(2^20 -1), the actual k is 19.

But in this case, the cumulative work on day 19 is W*(2^19 -1), which is much larger than 0.25*T. So the 25% is achieved on day 19.

However, this seems to suggest that the answer is 19 days, but this contradicts the initial thought of day 18. Given the calculations, it's 19 days. But why does the initial logic say day 18? Because if the task is completed on day 20, and each day's work is double the previous, then the work on day 19 is half of day 20's work, which would be half of the total task. Wait, no. If the total task is T = work up to day 20, and work on day 20 is 2^{19}W, then the work done on day 19 is 2^{18}W. The total work up to day 19 is W*(2^{19} -1). Which is W*(2^{19} -1) = W*(2^{19} -1). The total task T is W*(2^{20} -1). So the fraction of the task completed by day 19 is (2^{19} -1)/(2^{20} -1) ≈ (2^{19}/2^{20}) = 1/2. So about 50% of the task is done by day 19. Therefore, 25% would be achieved halfway through day 19, but since we're counting full days, it would be on day 19.

But this suggests that the answer is 19 days. However, this contradicts the earlier calculation where the cumulative work up to day 18 is 2^18 -1 = 262,143, and 25% of T is 262,143.75, which is just slightly more than day 18's cumulative work. So technically, the 25% is achieved on day 19, because day 18's cumulative work is just slightly less than 25%.

But this seems very close. Given that the difference is 0.75 units, which is negligible in the context of such large numbers, but the problem might expect a different approach.

Another way to think about it: if the task is completed on day 20, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the total work done on all previous days combined. Because doubling the work each day, so day 20's work is twice day 19's work, which is equal to the total work done before day 20. So total work T = work before day 20 + work on day 20 = work before day 20 + 2*work before day 20 = 3*work before day 20. Wait, this would mean that work before day 20 is T/3, and work on day 20 is 2T/3. But this seems different from earlier calculations.

Wait, let's define work before day 20 as S. Then work on day 20 is 2S. Total T = S + 2S = 3S. So S = T/3. Therefore, the work done up to day 19 is T/3, and on day 20 is 2T/3. So to find when the work is 25% of T, which is T/4. Since T/3 is approximately 33.33% of T, which is more than 25%. So the 25% would be achieved before day 19. But how?

If the work up to day 18 is S_prev, and work on day 19 is 2*S_prev. Then total work up to day 19 is S_prev + 2*S_prev = 3*S_prev. If this is equal to T/3 (from earlier), then 3*S_prev = T/3 → S_prev = T/9. So work up to day 18 is T/9 ≈ 11.11% of T. Work on day 19 is 2*S_prev = 2T/9 ≈ 22.22%. So the cumulative work up to day 19 is 3*S_prev = T/3 ≈ 33.33%. Therefore, the 25% is somewhere between day 18 and day 19. Since the work on day 19 is 22.22%, and the cumulative up to day 18 is 11.11%, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But since we're counting full days, it would be on day 19.

But this is getting too convoluted. Given the problem's phrasing, the most straightforward interpretation is that the task is completed on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task. In this case, the work done on day 20 is 2^{19}W, and the total task T = 2^{19}W. Then, 25% of T is 2^{17}W. The work done on day k is 2^{k-1}W. Setting 2^{k-1}W = 2^{17}W → k-1=17 → k=18. So the answer would be 18 days.

This seems to align with the initial thought. The confusion arises from whether the task is completed by the cumulative work over 20 days or by the work done on day 20. Given the problem's wording, it's more likely that the task is completed on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task. Hence, the answer would be 18 days.

But which interpretation is correct? Let's look for similar problems. In many problems where someone doubles their work each day and finishes a task on day N, it's often assumed that the work done on day N is the remaining part of the task, and the total task is the sum of all previous days plus the work on day N. However, in some cases, it's assumed that the work on day N is the entire task. This is a classic problem in geometric progression.

For example, a common problem is: "A man is doubling his work every day. He finishes a task on the 10th day. On which day did he finish half the task?" The answer is day 9, because on day 10, he does twice the work of day 9, so the work on day 10 is equal to the total work done before day 10. Hence, the total task is work up to day 10 = work up to day 9 + work on day 10 = work up to day 9 + 2*work up to day 9 = 3*work up to day 9. Therefore, work up to day 9 is 1/3 of the total task, and work on day 10 is 2/3. So half the task would be'

--- Question 45/50 ---
Question: A man is allocated a task. He doubles the task done everyday. If the man completely does the task in 20 days, how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of the task?
Model Raw Answer: <think>
Okay, let's try to figure this out. The problem says that a man doubles the task done every day and completes the entire task in 20 days. We need to find out how many days it took him to complete 25% of the task.

Hmm, so if he doubles the work each day, that means each day he's doing twice as much as the previous day. Let me think about how that works. If the total task is done on day 20, then on day 19, he must have done half of the total task because doubling that would make it the full amount. Wait, that makes sense because if you double the work each day, the day before completion, he would have done half the task. Then on day 20, he doubles that half to finish the whole task.

So, following that logic, the day before the last day (day 19) he had done 50% of the task. Then, the day before that, day 18, he would have done half of day 19's work, which is 25% of the total task. Because day 19's work is 50%, so half of that is 25%. Therefore, on day 18, he completed 25% of the task. So the answer should be 18 days.

Wait, let me check that again. Let's model it. Let's say the total task is T. On day 20, he finishes T. Let's think in reverse. On day 20, he does x amount of work, which is equal to T. But since he doubles each day, the work done on day 19 is x/2, and on day 18 is x/4, and so on. Wait, but if the total task is T, then the sum of all the work done each day up to day 20 is T. But the problem states that he doubles the task done every day. Wait, maybe I need to think about it as each day he does twice as much as the previous day. So the total work is the sum of a geometric series.

Wait, maybe I need to model it as the total work being the sum of each day's work. Let me think again. Let's suppose that on day 1, he does 1 unit of work. Then day 2, he does 2 units, day 3, 4 units, day 4, 8 units, and so on. So each day's work is 2^(n-1) units on day n. Then the total work after n days is 2^n - 1 units. Because the sum of a geometric series from 1 to 2^(n-1) is 2^n - 1.

But according to the problem, he completes the task in 20 days. So total work T = 2^20 - 1 units. Wait, but that might not be the case. Wait, maybe the problem is that he doubles the task done each day, so the amount he does each day is doubling. So if on day 1 he does x, day 2 he does 2x, day 3 he does 4x, etc. So the total work after n days is x*(2^n - 1). But the problem says he completes the task in 20 days. So the total work is x*(2^20 - 1). But maybe the problem is considering that on day 20, he finishes the task, meaning that the cumulative work up to day 20 is the total task. But if the task is completed on day 20, then perhaps the total task is equal to the work done on day 20. Wait, that might be a different interpretation.

Wait, the problem says "he doubles the task done every day. If the man completely does the task in 20 days..." So maybe each day he does twice as much as the previous day, and on day 20, he finishes the entire task. So the total work is the sum of all the work done each day up to day 20. But that would be a geometric series. However, if he completes the task on day 20, that could mean that the work done on day 20 alone is equal to the total task. But that would be a different scenario. Which interpretation is correct?

Let me think. If the task is completed in 20 days, that could mean that the total work done over 20 days is the entire task. But if he's doubling the work each day, then the work done on day 20 would be the largest portion. However, the total work would be the sum of all days. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that on day 20, he finishes the task, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the remaining part of the task. For example, if he doubles the work each day, then on day 20, he does enough work to finish the task. So the total task is equal to the work done on day 20. But that would mean that the previous days' work was cumulative, but the task is only completed on day 20. That might be the case.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the task is 1 unit. If he doubles the work each day, and on day 20 he completes the task. So on day 20, he does x work, and that x equals the remaining part of the task. But if he's doubling the work each day, then the work done each day is doubling. So if on day 1 he does x, day 2 2x, day 3 4x, ..., day 20 2^19 x. But the total task is the sum of all these? Or is the total task just the work done on day 20?

This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem statement again: "he doubles the task done everyday. If the man completely does the task in 20 days..." So "completely does the task in 20 days" probably means that after 20 days, the entire task is done. So the total work done over 20 days is the entire task. Therefore, the total work is the sum of a geometric series where each day's work is double the previous day's.

So, let's model this. Let the work done on day 1 be a. Then day 2: 2a, day 3: 4a, ..., day n: 2^{n-1}a. The total work after n days is a*(2^n - 1). So if the total task is T, then T = a*(2^20 - 1). But we need to find when he completed 25% of the task, which is T/4.

So, the total work done up to day k is a*(2^k - 1). We need this to be equal to T/4. Since T = a*(2^20 - 1), substituting:

a*(2^k - 1) = (a*(2^20 - 1))/4

Divide both sides by a:

2^k - 1 = (2^20 - 1)/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4*(2^k - 1) = 2^20 - 1

Expand left side:

4*2^k - 4 = 2^20 - 1

Rearrange:

4*2^k = 2^20 - 1 + 4

Which is:

4*2^k = 2^20 + 3

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the task is completed on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task. That is, the work done on day 20 is equal to the total task. In that case, the total task T = work done on day 20 = 2^{19}a (assuming day 1 is a). Then, the total work done up to day k is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i a = a*(2^k - 1). But if T = 2^{19}a, then:

a*(2^k - 1) = 25% of T = 0.25 * 2^{19}a

Divide both sides by a:

2^k - 1 = 0.25 * 2^{19}

Simplify the right side:

0.25 is 1/4, so 2^{19}/4 = 2^{19}/2^2 = 2^{17}

So:

2^k - 1 = 2^{17}

Then 2^k = 2^{17} + 1

But 2^{17} + 1 is not a power of two, so this seems problematic. Therefore, this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the man doubles the amount of work he does each day, and on day 20, he completes the task. So the work done on day 20 is equal to the total task. Then, the total work done up to day 20 is the sum of all previous days' work plus day 20's work. But if the total task is done on day 20, then the sum of all work up to day 20 is the total task. However, that would mean that the work done on day 20 is the same as the sum of all previous days. Because each day's work is double the previous day's. So, let's think:

Let’s say the work done on day 1 is x. Then day 2: 2x, day 3: 4x, ..., day 20: 2^{19}x.

The total work done up to day 20 is x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^{19}x = x*(2^{20} - 1). But the problem states that he completes the task in 20 days, so the total work T = x*(2^{20} - 1).

Now, we need to find the day when he completed 25% of the task, which is T/4 = x*(2^{20} - 1)/4.

Let’s find the smallest k such that the sum of work up to day k is ≥ T/4.

The sum up to day k is x*(2^k - 1). So:

x*(2^k - 1) ≥ x*(2^{20} - 1)/4

Divide both sides by x:

2^k - 1 ≥ (2^{20} - 1)/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4*(2^k - 1) ≥ 2^{20} - 1

Which simplifies to:

4*2^k - 4 ≥ 2^{20} - 1

Then:

4*2^k ≥ 2^{20} + 3

But 4 is 2^2, so:

2^2 * 2^k ≥ 2^{20} + 3

Which is:

2^{k+2} ≥ 2^{20} + 3

Since 2^{20} is much larger than 3, we can approximate 2^{k+2} ≈ 2^{20}, so k+2 ≈ 20 → k ≈ 18. So k=18.

Let’s check for k=18:

Left side: 4*(2^18 - 1) = 4*2^18 - 4 = 2^2*2^18 - 4 = 2^20 - 4

Right side: 2^20 - 1

So 2^20 - 4 ≥ 2^20 - 1? No, that's not true. 2^20 -4 is less than 2^20 -1. So the inequality doesn't hold for k=18.

Wait, but we need 4*(2^k -1) ≥ 2^20 -1.

So for k=18:

Left: 4*(2^18 -1) = 4*2^18 -4 = 2^20 -4

Which is 2^20 -4. Compare to right side 2^20 -1. So 2^20 -4 is less than 2^20 -1. So not enough.

For k=19:

Left: 4*(2^19 -1) = 4*2^19 -4 = 2^21 -4

Compare to 2^20 -1. 2^21 is 2*2^20, so 2^21 -4 is way larger than 2^20 -1. So the inequality holds for k=19.

But we need the smallest k where the sum up to day k is at least 25% of T. Since for k=18, the sum is 2^20 -4, and T is 2^20 -1. So 25% of T is (2^20 -1)/4. Let's compute the sum up to day 18, which is 2^18 -1 multiplied by x, but since T = x*(2^20 -1), the sum up to day 18 is (2^18 -1)/ (2^20 -1) * T. Let's compute that fraction:

(2^18 -1)/(2^20 -1) = (2^18 -1)/( (2^20 -1)) = approximately (2^18)/(2^20) = 1/4. But since 2^20 -1 is slightly larger than 2^20, and 2^18 -1 is slightly less than 2^18, the actual value is slightly less than 1/4. So the sum up to day 18 is slightly less than 25% of T. Therefore, the 25% is achieved on day 19.

But this contradicts the initial thought that day 18 would be 25%. So which is correct?

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the work done on day 20 is the entire task, and the previous days' work is cumulative. Let me think again.

If the man completes the task on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he finishes the task. If he doubles the work each day, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the total work done up to day 19 plus the work done on day 20. But that might not be the case. Wait, if he doubles the work each day, then the work done on day 20 is twice the work done on day 19. So if the total work is done on day 20, then the work done on day 20 is the remaining part of the task. So the total task is the sum of all work done up to day 20. But this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try a different approach. Let's think in terms of the last day. If the task is completed on day 20, and each day he doubles the work, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the sum of all previous days' work. Because if he doubles the work each day, then the work on day 20 is twice the work on day 19, which would be equal to the total work done before day 20. So:

Let’s denote the work done on day 1 as W. Then day 2: 2W, day 3: 4W, ..., day 20: 2^{19}W.

The total work done before day 20 is the sum from day 1 to day 19: W*(2^{19} - 1). The work done on day 20 is 2^{19}W. So the total task T is the sum up to day 20: W*(2^{19} - 1) + 2^{19}W = W*(2^{19} - 1 + 2^{19}) = W*(2*2^{19} -1) = W*(2^{20} -1). But this seems similar to the earlier approach.

But if the task is completed on day 20, then the total work is T = W*(2^{20} -1). Now, to find when he completed 25% of the task, which is T/4 = W*(2^{20} -1)/4.

We need to find the smallest k such that the sum of work up to day k is ≥ T/4.

The sum up to day k is W*(2^k -1). So:

W*(2^k -1) ≥ W*(2^{20} -1)/4 → 2^k -1 ≥ (2^{20} -1)/4.

As before, solving this:

Multiply both sides by 4: 4*2^k -4 ≥ 2^{20} -1 → 4*2^k ≥ 2^{20} +3.

Since 2^{20} is much larger than 3, we can approximate 4*2^k ≈ 2^{20} → 2^{k+2} ≈ 2^{20} → k+2 = 20 → k=18.

But checking with exact values:

For k=18:

Left side: 4*(2^18 -1) = 4*2^18 -4 = 2^20 -4.

Right side: 2^20 -1.

So 2^20 -4 ≥ 2^20 -1? No, because -4 is less than -1. Therefore, the inequality is not satisfied for k=18.

For k=19:

Left side: 4*(2^19 -1) = 4*2^19 -4 = 2^21 -4.

Compare to right side: 2^20 -1. Since 2^21 is 2*2^20, 2^21 -4 is definitely greater than 2^20 -1. So the inequality holds for k=19.

Therefore, the smallest k where the sum up to day k is at least 25% of T is 19 days. But wait, this contradicts the earlier thought that day 18 would be 25%. What's the issue here?

Wait, the problem says "completely does the task in 20 days". So the total task is completed on day 20. So the sum up to day 20 is T. Now, we need to find when the sum up to day k is 25% of T. So, solving 2^k -1 = (2^20 -1)/4. Let me compute (2^20 -1)/4. Let's approximate 2^20 is 1,048,576. So (1,048,576 -1)/4 = 1,048,575 /4 = 262,143.75.

Now, 2^k -1 = 262,143.75. Solving for k:

2^k = 262,143.75 +1 = 262,144.75. Now, 2^18 is 262,144. So 2^18 = 262,144. So 2^k is approximately 262,144.75, which is just slightly more than 2^18. Therefore, k is slightly more than 18. But since k must be an integer, the sum up to day 18 is 2^18 -1 = 262,144 -1 = 262,143, which is just 0.75 less than 262,143.75. Therefore, the sum up to day 18 is slightly less than 25% of T, and the sum up to day 19 is 2^19 -1 = 524,287, which is much more than 262,143.75. Therefore, the 25% of the task is completed on day 19.

But wait, this seems to suggest that it's day 19. But earlier I thought day 18. Which is correct?

Let me check with actual numbers. Suppose T = 2^20 -1 = 1,048,575.

25% of T is 1,048,575 * 0.25 = 262,143.75.

Sum up to day 18: 2^18 -1 = 262,144 -1 = 262,143. Which is 0.75 less than 262,143.75. So on day 18, the sum is 262,143, which is just short of 25%. Then on day 19, he adds 2^18 = 262,144 units. So the total sum after day 19 is 262,143 + 262,144 = 524,287, which is more than 262,143.75. Therefore, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But the question asks "how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of the task?" If the task is completed during day 19, then it took 19 days to reach 25%. But the problem might be considering that the work is done in discrete days, and the 25% is achieved exactly on day 19. However, since the sum up to day 18 is just slightly less than 25%, and day 19's work brings it over, the answer would be 19 days.

But this contradicts the initial thought that day 18 would be 25%. Where is the mistake?

Ah, perhaps the problem is not about the cumulative work but about the work done on a particular day. For example, if the task is completed on day 20, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the total task. In that case, the work done on day 20 is 2^{19}W, and the total task T = 2^{19}W. Then, the work done on day k is 2^{k-1}W. We need to find when the work done on day k is 25% of T, which is 0.25 * 2^{19}W = 2^{17}W. Setting 2^{k-1}W = 2^{17}W → k-1 = 17 → k=18. So in this interpretation, the answer is 18 days.

This seems to be a different interpretation of the problem. The key is whether the task is completed on day 20 by doing the work on day 20 alone, or by accumulating work over 20 days.

The problem states: "the man completely does the task in 20 days". This could mean that after 20 days, the task is done, which would imply that the cumulative work over 20 days is the task. However, another interpretation is that he finishes the task on the 20th day, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the remaining part of the task.

This ambiguity is critical. Let's look at the exact wording: "he doubles the task done everyday. If the man completely does the task in 20 days, how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of the task?"

The phrase "completely does the task in 20 days" likely means that the entire task is done by the end of day 20, implying that the cumulative work up to day 20 is the total task. Therefore, the first interpretation where the sum of work over 20 days is T is correct. In that case, as calculated earlier, the 25% is achieved on day 19.

But this leads to a fractional day, which is not possible. However, since the work is done in discrete days, the 25% is achieved during day 19, so the answer is 19 days.

But this seems counterintuitive. Let's try with smaller numbers. Suppose the task is completed in 2 days. So total work is sum of day 1 and day 2. Let's say day 1: x, day 2: 2x. Total T = 3x. 25% of T is 0.75x. The sum after day 1 is x, which is more than 0.75x. So the 25% is achieved on day 1. But according to the formula, solving 2^k -1 = (2^2 -1)/4 → 2^k -1 = 3/4 → 2^k = 1.75 → k is between 0 and 1, which doesn't make sense. Wait, this shows the formula might not be applicable for small numbers. So perhaps the initial approach is flawed.

Alternatively, if the task is completed on day 2, meaning that the work done on day 2 is the total task. So T = 2x. Then, 25% of T is 0.5x. The work done on day 1 is x, which is 50% of T. So 25% would be achieved on day 1 if we consider the work done on day 1 is 50% of T, which is more than 25%. So this doesn't help.

This suggests that the interpretation is crucial. Given the problem's wording, the most logical interpretation is that the total work is completed on day 20, meaning that the cumulative work up to day 20 is the total task. In this case, the calculation shows that the 25% is achieved on day 19. However, the earlier example with day 2 shows inconsistency, which might be due to the small numbers.

Alternatively, let's think of the task as being completed on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he does the last part of the task. If the work doubles each day, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the sum of all work done before day 20. Because if he doubles the work each day, then day 20's work is twice day 19's work, which would be equal to the total work done before day 20. So:

Let’s denote the work on day 1 as W. Then day 2: 2W, day 3: 4W, ..., day 20: 2^{19}W.

Total work done before day 20: W + 2W + 4W + ... + 2^{18}W = W*(2^{19} - 1). Work done on day 20: 2^{19}W. Total task T = work before day 20 + work on day 20 = W*(2^{19} -1) + 2^{19}W = W*(2^{20} -1). So this is the same as before.

Now, to find when the cumulative work is 25% of T, which is 0.25 * W*(2^{20} -1).

The cumulative work up to day k is W*(2^k -1). Setting this equal to 0.25 * W*(2^{20} -1):

2^k -1 = 0.25*(2^{20} -1)

As before, solving this gives k ≈ 18. But since 2^18 -1 is slightly less than 0.25*(2^20 -1), the actual k is 19.

But in this case, the cumulative work on day 19 is W*(2^19 -1), which is much larger than 0.25*T. So the 25% is achieved on day 19.

However, this seems to suggest that the answer is 19 days, but this contradicts the initial thought of day 18. Given the calculations, it's 19 days. But why does the initial logic say day 18? Because if the task is completed on day 20, and each day's work is double the previous, then the work on day 19 is half of day 20's work, which would be half of the total task. Wait, no. If the total task is T = work up to day 20, and work on day 20 is 2^{19}W, then the work done on day 19 is 2^{18}W. The total work up to day 19 is W*(2^{19} -1). Which is W*(2^{19} -1) = W*(2^{19} -1). The total task T is W*(2^{20} -1). So the fraction of the task completed by day 19 is (2^{19} -1)/(2^{20} -1) ≈ (2^{19}/2^{20}) = 1/2. So about 50% of the task is done by day 19. Therefore, 25% would be achieved halfway through day 19, but since we're counting full days, it would be on day 19.

But this suggests that the answer is 19 days. However, this contradicts the earlier calculation where the cumulative work up to day 18 is 2^18 -1 = 262,143, and 25% of T is 262,143.75, which is just slightly more than day 18's cumulative work. So technically, the 25% is achieved on day 19, because day 18's cumulative work is just slightly less than 25%.

But this seems very close. Given that the difference is 0.75 units, which is negligible in the context of such large numbers, but the problem might expect a different approach.

Another way to think about it: if the task is completed on day 20, then the work done on day 20 is equal to the total work done on all previous days combined. Because doubling the work each day, so day 20's work is twice day 19's work, which is equal to the total work done before day 20. So total work T = work before day 20 + work on day 20 = work before day 20 + 2*work before day 20 = 3*work before day 20. Wait, this would mean that work before day 20 is T/3, and work on day 20 is 2T/3. But this seems different from earlier calculations.

Wait, let's define work before day 20 as S. Then work on day 20 is 2S. Total T = S + 2S = 3S. So S = T/3. Therefore, the work done up to day 19 is T/3, and on day 20 is 2T/3. So to find when the work is 25% of T, which is T/4. Since T/3 is approximately 33.33% of T, which is more than 25%. So the 25% would be achieved before day 19. But how?

If the work up to day 18 is S_prev, and work on day 19 is 2*S_prev. Then total work up to day 19 is S_prev + 2*S_prev = 3*S_prev. If this is equal to T/3 (from earlier), then 3*S_prev = T/3 → S_prev = T/9. So work up to day 18 is T/9 ≈ 11.11% of T. Work on day 19 is 2*S_prev = 2T/9 ≈ 22.22%. So the cumulative work up to day 19 is 3*S_prev = T/3 ≈ 33.33%. Therefore, the 25% is somewhere between day 18 and day 19. Since the work on day 19 is 22.22%, and the cumulative up to day 18 is 11.11%, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But since we're counting full days, it would be on day 19.

But this is getting too convoluted. Given the problem's phrasing, the most straightforward interpretation is that the task is completed on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task. In this case, the work done on day 20 is 2^{19}W, and the total task T = 2^{19}W. Then, 25% of T is 2^{17}W. The work done on day k is 2^{k-1}W. Setting 2^{k-1}W = 2^{17}W → k-1=17 → k=18. So the answer would be 18 days.

This seems to align with the initial thought. The confusion arises from whether the task is completed by the cumulative work over 20 days or by the work done on day 20. Given the problem's wording, it's more likely that the task is completed on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task. Hence, the answer would be 18 days.

But which interpretation is correct? Let's look for similar problems. In many problems where someone doubles their work each day and finishes a task on day N, it's often assumed that the work done on day N is the remaining part of the task, and the total task is the sum of all previous days plus the work on day N. However, in some cases, it's assumed that the work on day N is the entire task. This is a classic problem in geometric progression.

For example, a common problem is: "A man is doubling his work every day. He finishes a task on the 10th day. On which day did he finish half the task?" The answer is day 9, because on day 10, he does twice the work of day 9, so the work on day 10 is equal to the total work done before day 10. Hence, the total task is work up to day 10 = work up to day 9 + work on day 10 = work up to day 9 + 2*work up to day 9 = 3*work up to day 9. Therefore, work up to day 9 is 1/3 of the total task, and work on day 10 is 2/3. So half the task would be

Okay, let's try to figure out this airplane problem. So, the question is about finding the minimum number of airplanes needed to get one plane all the way around the world, with all planes returning safely. Each plane can only fly half the distance around the world on a full tank. They can refuel in flight without any loss, and the island is the only fuel source.

Hmm, I remember this is a classic puzzle. Let me think. The key here is that the planes can transfer fuel to each other mid-air. Since each plane can only go half the distance, they need to have other planes accompany them to carry extra fuel. But all planes must return safely, so any fuel given to the main plane has to be accounted for in terms of the returning planes.

Let me break it down. Let's say we want to get one plane around the world. The total distance is 1 unit (let's say 1/2 way is 0.5 units). Wait, no, the problem says each plane can fly exactly 1/2 way around the world. So the full circle is 1 unit, and each plane can go 0.5 units on a full tank. So to go all the way around, the plane needs to have enough fuel for 1 unit, but since each tank is only 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled mid-flight.

But how? If another plane can carry extra fuel, maybe they can meet at some point, transfer fuel, and then return. Let's think about the classic problem. I think the answer is 3 planes, but I need to verify.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, if you have two planes. They start together. Each has a fuel capacity of 0.5 units. They fly together for a certain distance, then one transfers some fuel to the other, then returns. Let's say they fly x distance. Each consumes x fuel. So the total fuel used by both planes is 2x. But since each has 0.5 units, they can only go so far.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of fuel transfers. Let's consider that each plane can carry fuel for 0.5 units. If two planes fly together, they can share fuel. For example, if two planes fly together for a distance d, each uses d fuel. Then, one plane can transfer some fuel to the other. But since they need to return, the transferring plane can't give all its fuel. Let me try with two planes.

Suppose two planes start together. They fly for d distance. Each has used d fuel. So each has 0.5 - d fuel left. Now, if one plane transfers fuel to the other, the transferring plane needs to have enough fuel to return. So the transferring plane can give up to (0.5 - d) - (0.5 - d) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the transferring plane needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is d, so it needs d fuel. So the amount of fuel it can transfer is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d. But that has to be non-negative. So 0.5 - 2d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 0.25.

So, if they fly 0.25 distance, then each has 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 fuel left. The transferring plane can give 0.25 - 0.25 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the transferring plane needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is 0.25, so it needs 0.25 fuel. So after flying 0.25, it has 0.25 fuel. So it can give 0.25 - 0.25 = 0 to the other plane? That doesn't help. So maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe more planes are needed. Let me think of the classic problem where multiple planes help. For example, the problem where you need to get a plane around the world with multiple planes acting as fuel carriers.

In the classic problem, the answer is 3 planes. Let me try to work through that.

Let's assume the total distance is 1 unit (so half the world is 0.5 units). Each plane can carry 1 unit of fuel, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says each plane can fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, so the fuel capacity is enough for 0.5 units of distance. Wait, maybe I need to model fuel as a quantity that allows the plane to fly a certain distance. So each plane can carry fuel for 0.5 units of distance. So if a plane flies x distance, it uses x fuel.

So, to get a plane to go around the world (distance 1), it needs to have fuel for 1 unit. But since each plane can carry only 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled.

The classic solution involves multiple planes assisting by transferring fuel. Let me think step by step.

Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C. All start together. They fly together for a certain distance, then some planes transfer fuel and return, while others continue.

Let me try with three planes. Let's say they fly together for distance d. Each plane uses d fuel. So each has 0.5 - d fuel left.

At this point, planes B and C can transfer some fuel to plane A, then return to the island. But how much fuel can they transfer?

Plane B and C need to have enough fuel to return to the island. The distance back is d, so each needs d fuel. So the amount of fuel they can give to plane A is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d.

So each of B and C can give 0.5 - 2d fuel to A. So total fuel given to A would be 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d.

But plane A already has 0.5 - d fuel left. So total fuel in A after receiving is (0.5 - d) + (1 - 4d) = 1.5 - 5d.

Plane A needs to have enough fuel to go the remaining distance. The total distance is 1, and they've already gone d, so remaining is 1 - d. So 1.5 - 5d must be ≥ 1 - d → 1.5 -5d ≥ 1 -d → 0.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ 0.125.

So if d is 0.125, then:

Fuel given by B and C: 0.5 - 2*(0.125) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 each. So total 0.5.

Plane A's fuel after transfer: 0.5 - 0.125 + 0.5 = 0.875.

Plane A needs to go 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 distance. So exactly enough. So plane A can make it to the halfway point, but wait, the total distance is 1. Wait, no, the total distance around the world is 1. So if the plane starts at the airport, goes d=0.125, then gets 0.875 fuel, which allows it to go 0.875 distance. So total distance would be 0.125 + 0.875 = 1.0. So that works. But then, after that, plane A would have zero fuel. Wait, but the problem says the plane must get all the way around the world. Wait, but if plane A reaches the end, it's done. But the problem says all planes must return safely. Wait, but in this scenario, plane A is the one going around, and planes B and C return. So plane A is the one that needs to go around, but how does it return? Wait, no, the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world", but the question is about getting one plane around the world, and all planes must return safely. Wait, but if plane A goes around the world, it would have to return, right? Because the problem says all planes must return safely. Wait, but the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world" but then all planes must return. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the problem is that the plane that goes around the world doesn't need to return? Or maybe the question is that the plane goes around the world and returns? Wait, the wording says "get one airplane all the way around the world", which is a full circle, so it must return to the airport. So all planes, including the one that goes around, must return.

Wait, that complicates things. So the plane that goes around the world must return, so it needs fuel for the entire trip. So the total fuel required is for going around the world (distance 1) and returning (another 1), but that's a total of 2 units. But each plane can carry 0.5 units. So that's impossible unless they have multiple refuels.

Wait, but the problem says the plane can fly exactly 1/2 way around the world on a full tank. So maybe the total distance around the world is 1 unit, so each plane can fly 0.5 units on a full tank. So to go around the world (distance 1), the plane would need two full tanks, but it can't carry that. Hence, the need for other planes to help carry fuel.

But the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world", which is a full circle, so the plane must return. So the total distance is 1 unit (around the world), and the plane needs to have enough fuel for that trip. But each plane can only carry enough for 0.5 units. So the plane needs to be refueled mid-flight.

But how? Let me think again. Let's consider that the plane needs to have fuel for the entire trip. So maybe multiple planes help carry fuel to the main plane at various points.

In the classic problem where planes can refuel and return, the minimum number of planes required is 3. But I need to verify that.

Let me think of the process. Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C. They all start together. They fly together for a certain distance, then B and C transfer fuel to A and return. Then A continues, but maybe needs more help.

Wait, but if A gets enough fuel to go halfway, but then needs to return. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to look up the standard solution, but since I can't do that, I'll try to work it out.

Another approach: The total fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world is 1 unit (distance). But each time a plane helps, it can transfer some fuel. However, each helper plane must also return, so they need to have fuel for their own return trip.

Let me think in terms of fuel consumption. Let's say the main plane needs to have 1 unit of fuel. Each helper plane can carry 0.5 units, but they also need to return, so they can't give all their fuel.

For example, if a helper plane accompanies the main plane for distance d, then returns. The helper plane uses d fuel to go out and d fuel to return, so total 2d. But the helper plane can only carry 0.5 units. Therefore, 2d ≤ 0.5 → d ≤ 0.25. So the helper can go out 0.25 units, transfer some fuel, and return.

So if the helper plane goes out 0.25 units, uses 0.25 fuel, and has 0.25 left. Then, to return, it needs 0.25 fuel. So it can't transfer any fuel. That's not helpful. So maybe two helpers?

Wait, maybe multiple helpers can meet at a point and transfer fuel. Let's consider three planes. All three start together. They fly for a distance d. Each uses d fuel. Now, they have 0.5 - d fuel left. At this point, two planes (say B and C) can transfer fuel to plane A, then return. How much can they transfer?

Each of B and C needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is d, so they need d fuel. So each of B and C can give up to (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d fuel to plane A.

So total fuel given to A is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d.

Plane A's fuel after transfer is (0.5 - d) + (1 - 4d) = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, plane A needs to have enough fuel to go the remaining distance. The total distance is 1, so after flying d, the remaining is 1 - d. So 1.5 - 5d ≥ 1 - d → 0.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ 0.125.

So if d is 0.125, then:

Fuel given by B and C: 0.5 - 2*(0.125) = 0.25 each. Total 0.5.

Plane A's fuel after transfer: 0.5 - 0.125 + 0.5 = 0.875.

Plane A needs to go 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 distance. So exactly enough. So plane A can make it to the end of the journey, but then how does it return? Wait, the problem says all planes must return safely. So plane A must return as well. So this approach only gets plane A halfway? No, wait, the total distance is 1, so if plane A goes 0.125, then gets 0.875 fuel, which allows it to go 0.875 distance. So total distance is 0.125 + 0.875 = 1.0. So plane A reaches the destination, but then needs to return. But it has no fuel left. So this doesn't work.

Ah, right! So the problem is that the main plane needs to go around the world and return. So the total distance is 2 units (there and back), but the plane can only carry 0.5 units. So the main plane needs to be refueled multiple times.

This complicates things. So maybe the solution requires multiple stages of refueling.

Let me think of the problem as needing to get the main plane to have enough fuel for the entire trip. Let's consider that the main plane needs to have fuel for the entire 1 unit trip around the world. But since it can't carry enough, other planes help by transferring fuel at various points.

This is similar to the classic "jeep problem" where a jeep needs to cross a desert with multiple trips to cache fuel. But in this case, the planes can fly in formation and transfer fuel mid-air.

In the classic problem with multiple planes, the minimum number required is 3. But I need to check the steps again.

Let me try with three planes again, but this time considering that the main plane needs to return. Wait, but if the main plane needs to go around the world and return, that's a total of 2 units. So the fuel required is 2 units. But each plane can carry 0.5 units. So the total fuel needed is 2 units, but the planes can carry 0.5 units each. So how many planes are needed?

But the planes can help by transferring fuel. Let me think of the process as multiple stages.

First, all planes fly together for a certain distance, then some planes transfer fuel and return, while others continue. Then, the remaining planes repeat the process.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to find a known solution. From what I remember, the answer is 3 planes. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, maybe it's 5 planes. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: Each time a plane helps, it can provide fuel to the main plane. But since all planes must return, the fuel they provide is limited.

Let me consider that to get the main plane around the world, it needs to have fuel for the entire trip. Let's say the main plane needs to have fuel for 1 unit. Each helper plane can contribute some fuel, but they also need to return.

Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C. All start together. They fly for a distance d. At this point, each has used d fuel, so they have 0.5 - d left.

Now, planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return. The amount they can transfer is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d each. So total transferred to A is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d.

Plane A now has 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d fuel.

Now, plane A needs to go the remaining distance (1 - d) and then return. Wait, no, the total trip is around the world, which is 1 unit. So if plane A is at distance d from the start, it needs to go 1 - d more to complete the circle. But then it needs to return, which is another 1 unit. Wait, no, the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world", which is a full circle. So the plane needs to go from the airport, fly around the world, and return to the airport. So the total distance is 2 units (there and back). But each plane can only carry 0.5 units of fuel. So the main plane needs to have enough fuel for 2 units, but it can only carry 0.5. Hence, the need for help.

So let's adjust the previous calculation. The main plane needs to go 1 unit (around the world) and then return 1 unit. Total 2 units. But with help from other planes.

Let me try with three planes again. Suppose they fly together for distance d. Then planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return.

Plane A now has 1.5 - 5d fuel. This fuel needs to be enough for the remaining distance to go around the world and return. Wait, but after flying d, the plane has to go 1 - d to complete the circle, then 1 unit to return. Total of 2 - d units. So 1.5 - 5d ≥ 2 - d → 1.5 - 5d ≥ 2 - d → -1.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ -0.375. Which is impossible. So this approach isn't working.

Hmm, I must be misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport."

So the main plane needs to go around the world (distance 1), and return to the airport. So total distance is 2 units. But each plane can only carry 0.5 units of fuel. So the main plane needs to have enough fuel for 2 units. But with help from other planes.

Let me think of the problem as needing to have fuel at various points along the journey. For example, if we have multiple planes that can meet the main plane at certain points and transfer fuel.

Let me consider the classic problem where the minimum number is 3. But I need to see how that works.

Another approach: The total amount of fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world and return is 2 units. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. But the other planes can help by carrying extra fuel to the main plane.

However, each helper plane must also return to the airport, so they need to have fuel for their own trips.

Let me think of it as multiple trips. For example, if a helper plane flies out with the main plane for a distance, transfers some fuel, and returns. The fuel transferred is the amount that the helper can give without needing to carry extra fuel for their return.

Let me try with two helper planes. Suppose the main plane is accompanied by two helpers. They all start together. They fly together for distance d. Each uses d fuel. Now, the helpers can transfer fuel to the main plane and return.

Each helper has 0.5 - d fuel left. To return, they need d fuel. So they can transfer (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d fuel to the main plane.

So two helpers can transfer 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d fuel to the main plane.

The main plane has 0.5 - d fuel from its own tank plus the transferred fuel, so total is 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, the main plane needs to have enough fuel to go the remaining distance to complete the circle and return. The remaining distance is 1 - d (to complete the circle) plus 1 (to return), totaling 2 - d. So 1.5 - 5d ≥ 2 - d → 1.5 -5d ≥ 2 -d → -1.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ -0.375. Which is impossible. So this approach doesn't work with two helpers.

Now, let's try with three helpers. So four planes: main, A, B, C. They all start together. They fly for distance d. Each uses d fuel. Now, planes A, B, and C can transfer fuel to the main plane and return.

Each of A, B, C has 0.5 - d fuel left. To return, they need d fuel, so they can transfer (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d each. Total transferred is 3*(0.5 - 2d) = 1.5 - 6d.

Main plane's fuel after transfer: 0.5 - d + 1.5 - 6d = 2 - 7d.

Now, the main plane needs to have enough fuel for the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 1 - d (to complete the circle) + 1 (to return) = 2 - d. So 2 - 7d ≥ 2 - d → -7d ≥ -d → -6d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 0. Which is impossible. So this also doesn't work.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of it as multiple stages where planes help at different points.

In the classic problem, the solution involves multiple planes helping at different points. For example, planes help each other at certain distances, transferring fuel and returning. This is similar to the problem of crossing a desert with multiple trips.

Let me think of the problem as needing to have fuel caches at certain points. For example, if you have planes that can carry fuel to a certain point, then return, allowing the main plane to have more fuel.

Let me try with three planes again, but this time considering that the main plane needs to go halfway and then return, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the problem states that the main plane needs to go all the way around the world, which is a full circle. So it's not just halfway. So the main plane needs to have enough fuel for the entire trip.

Another idea: The total fuel required for the main plane to go around the world and return is 2 units. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. So the total fuel needed is 2 units. However, each helper plane can contribute some fuel, but they also need to return. So the total fuel available from all planes is the number of planes multiplied by 0.5 units. But since the main plane is using some of that fuel, we need to calculate how many planes are needed.

But this is too vague. Let me think of it in terms of fuel transfer.

Suppose we have n planes. They all start together. They fly for distance d, then some planes transfer fuel and return, while others continue. The process is repeated until the main plane has enough fuel.

Let me try with three planes again, but this time considering that after the first transfer, the main plane needs more help.

First, three planes (A, B, C) start together. They fly for distance d. Each uses d fuel, so they have 0.5 - d left.

Now, planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return. As before, each can transfer 0.5 - 2d fuel. Total transferred is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d. Main plane A now has 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, plane A needs to continue. Let's say it flies another distance e. It uses e fuel, so it has 1.5 - 5d - e fuel left. Then, it needs to return, which is another distance of (d + e) to go back? No, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe after the first transfer, plane A has enough fuel to go to the halfway point and then get help again. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the solution is 3 planes, but I'm missing something in the calculation. Let me try with d = 1/8 (0.125).

At d = 0.125, the transferred fuel is 1 - 4*(0.125) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. So main plane A has 1.5 - 5*(0.125) = 1.5 - 0.625 = 0.875 fuel.

Now, plane A needs to go the remaining distance to complete the circle and return. Let's see, after flying 0.125, it needs to go 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 to complete the circle, then 1 to return. Total of 1.875 units. But it only has 0.875 fuel, which is not enough. So this doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe the solution involves multiple stages with more planes. Let me think of the classic problem where the answer is 3 planes. Maybe I'm missing that the main plane doesn't need to return, but the problem states all planes must return. Wait, the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport." So the main plane must return as well. So it's a round trip.

This seems extremely challenging. Maybe the answer is 3 planes, but I'm not seeing the steps. Let me try to think of it as needing to have enough fuel at the halfway point.

If the main plane needs to go halfway (0.5 units) and then return, but that's not the case here. Wait, the problem is to go all the way around the world, which is a full circle. So it's 1 unit, and the plane needs to return, making it 2 units total.

Let me think of it as needing to have fuel at the halfway point. Suppose we have planes that help carry fuel to the halfway point, then return.

For example, if a plane flies to the halfway point, transfers some fuel, and returns. The fuel needed for that trip is 0.5 units out and 0.5 units back, total 1 unit. But the plane can only carry 0.5 units. So it can't do that alone. So it needs help from other planes.

This is similar to the problem where you need multiple planes to carry fuel to a certain point.

Let me try with three planes again. All three start together. They fly to a point d, transfer fuel, and return. Let's say they fly to d, transfer fuel, and return. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. Let's say they fly to d, then transfer fuel to the main plane, and return.

But this is getting too vague. I think I need to look up the standard solution, but since I can't, I'll try to recall that the minimum number is 3 planes for a round trip. However, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be 5 planes.

Wait, I remember that in the classic problem where a plane needs to fly around the world with multiple planes, the minimum number is 3. But I'm not sure. Let me think of it as follows:

The main plane needs to have enough fuel for the entire trip. Let's say it gets help from two other planes at certain points.

First, all three planes fly together for a distance d. At this point, each has used d fuel. Now, the two helper planes transfer fuel to the main plane and return. The amount they can transfer is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d each. Total transferred is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d. Main plane now has 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, the main plane needs to continue. Let's say it flies another distance e, using e fuel. So it has 1.5 - 5d - e fuel left. Then, it needs to return, which is a distance of (d + e) to go back? No, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, after the first transfer, the main plane has 1.5 - 5d fuel. Let's set this equal to the fuel needed to go the remaining distance and return. The remaining distance to complete the circle is 1 - d, and then return is 1 unit. Total is 2 - d. So 1.5 - 5d = 2 - d → 1.5 - 5d = 2 - d → -1.5 = 4d → d = -0.375, which is impossible.

This suggests that with three planes, it's not possible. Maybe more planes are needed.

Let me try with four planes. Let's say the main plane is accompanied by three helpers. They all start together, fly for distance d. Each uses d fuel, so they have 0.5 - d left. Now, the three helpers can transfer fuel to the main plane and return.

Each helper can transfer (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d. Total transferred is 3*(0.5 - 2d) = 1.5 - 6d.

Main plane now has 0.5 - d + 1.5 - 6d = 2 - 7d.

This needs to be enough for the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 2 - d (as before). So 2 - 7d ≥ 2 - d → -7d ≥ -d → -6d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 0. Still impossible.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe the approach is wrong. Perhaps the main plane needs to be assisted at multiple points.

Let me think of it in stages. Suppose the main plane needs to go from the airport to a point A, then to a point B, then to the destination, and then back. At each point, other planes help by transferring fuel.

For example, let's say we have three planes: A, B, and C.

First, all three fly together to point A, which is 1/8 of the way around the world (distance d = 1/8). Each uses 1/8 fuel, so they have 0.5 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel left.

At point A, planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return. Each of B and C needs to have enough fuel to return to the airport, which is 1/8 distance back. So they need 1/8 fuel. Each has 3/8 fuel, so they can transfer 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel to plane A. Total transferred is 2*(1/4) = 1/2.

Plane A now has its original 3/8 + 1/2 = 3/8 + 4/8 = 7/8 fuel.

Now, plane A continues from point A to the halfway point (distance 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8). It uses 3/8 fuel, leaving it with 7/8 - 3/8 = 4/8 = 1/2 fuel.

At the halfway point, another plane (let's say plane D) meets plane A and transfers fuel. Plane D has flown from the airport to the halfway point, using 1/2 fuel, so it has 0.5 - 1/2 = 0 fuel left. That doesn't help. So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe more planes are needed at the halfway point. Let's say two planes help at the halfway point.

But this is getting too complex. I think I need to recall that the answer is 3 planes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be 5 planes.

Wait, I found a reference in my mind that for a round trip, the minimum number is 3 planes. Let me try to think of it as follows:

Three planes start together. They fly 1/8 of the way. Each uses 1/8 fuel, leaving 3/8. Two of them transfer 1/4 fuel each to the third, then return. The third plane now has 3/8 + 2*(1/4) = 3/8 + 1/2 = 7/8 fuel. It then continues to the 1/2 mark, using 3/8 fuel, leaving 7/8 - 3/8 = 1/2. At the 1/2 mark, it needs to continue, but it has 1/2 fuel. To go the remaining 1/2 distance to complete the circle and return, it needs 1 unit. So it's short. But another plane could help here.

Wait, maybe the third plane is now at the 1/2 mark with 1/2 fuel. It needs to go 1/2 more to complete the circle and then 1 unit to return. Total of 1.5 units. It only has 1/2. So it needs more help.

Another plane could fly to the 1/2 mark, transfer fuel, and return. Let's say a fourth plane flies to the 1/2 mark. It uses 1/2 fuel, leaving 0.5 - 1/2 = 0. So it can't transfer anything. Not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. I think I need to conclude that the minimum number is 3 planes, even though my calculations aren't showing it, but I might be missing something. Alternatively, the answer is 5 planes.

Wait, another approach: Each time a plane helps, it can provide a certain amount of fuel. For the main plane to go around the world, it needs 2 units of fuel (since it's a round trip). Each helper plane can provide 0.5 units of fuel, but they also need to return, so they can only contribute a portion.

Let me think of it as needing to have 2 units of fuel for the main plane. Each helper plane can contribute some amount. Let's say n helper planes are used. Each can contribute'

--- Question 50/50 ---
Question: On an Island, there is an airport that has an unlimited number of identical air-planes. Each air-plane has a fuel capacity to allow it to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, along a great circle. The planes have the ability to refuel in flight without loss of speed or spillage of fuel. Though the fuel is unlimited, the island is the only source of fuel. You can ignore the time and fuel consumption of refuelling.
What is the minimum number of air-planes required to get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport?
Model Raw Answer: <think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this airplane problem. So, the question is about finding the minimum number of airplanes needed to get one plane all the way around the world, with all planes returning safely. Each plane can only fly half the distance around the world on a full tank. They can refuel in flight without any loss, and the island is the only fuel source.

Hmm, I remember this is a classic puzzle. Let me think. The key here is that the planes can transfer fuel to each other mid-air. Since each plane can only go half the distance, they need to have other planes accompany them to carry extra fuel. But all planes must return safely, so any fuel given to the main plane has to be accounted for in terms of the returning planes.

Let me break it down. Let's say we want to get one plane around the world. The total distance is 1 unit (let's say 1/2 way is 0.5 units). Wait, no, the problem says each plane can fly exactly 1/2 way around the world. So the full circle is 1 unit, and each plane can go 0.5 units on a full tank. So to go all the way around, the plane needs to have enough fuel for 1 unit, but since each tank is only 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled mid-flight.

But how? If another plane can carry extra fuel, maybe they can meet at some point, transfer fuel, and then return. Let's think about the classic problem. I think the answer is 3 planes, but I need to verify.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, if you have two planes. They start together. Each has a fuel capacity of 0.5 units. They fly together for a certain distance, then one transfers some fuel to the other, then returns. Let's say they fly x distance. Each consumes x fuel. So the total fuel used by both planes is 2x. But since each has 0.5 units, they can only go so far.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of fuel transfers. Let's consider that each plane can carry fuel for 0.5 units. If two planes fly together, they can share fuel. For example, if two planes fly together for a distance d, each uses d fuel. Then, one plane can transfer some fuel to the other. But since they need to return, the transferring plane can't give all its fuel. Let me try with two planes.

Suppose two planes start together. They fly for d distance. Each has used d fuel. So each has 0.5 - d fuel left. Now, if one plane transfers fuel to the other, the transferring plane needs to have enough fuel to return. So the transferring plane can give up to (0.5 - d) - (0.5 - d) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the transferring plane needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is d, so it needs d fuel. So the amount of fuel it can transfer is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d. But that has to be non-negative. So 0.5 - 2d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 0.25.

So, if they fly 0.25 distance, then each has 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 fuel left. The transferring plane can give 0.25 - 0.25 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the transferring plane needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is 0.25, so it needs 0.25 fuel. So after flying 0.25, it has 0.25 fuel. So it can give 0.25 - 0.25 = 0 to the other plane? That doesn't help. So maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe more planes are needed. Let me think of the classic problem where multiple planes help. For example, the problem where you need to get a plane around the world with multiple planes acting as fuel carriers.

In the classic problem, the answer is 3 planes. Let me try to work through that.

Let's assume the total distance is 1 unit (so half the world is 0.5 units). Each plane can carry 1 unit of fuel, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says each plane can fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, so the fuel capacity is enough for 0.5 units of distance. Wait, maybe I need to model fuel as a quantity that allows the plane to fly a certain distance. So each plane can carry fuel for 0.5 units of distance. So if a plane flies x distance, it uses x fuel.

So, to get a plane to go around the world (distance 1), it needs to have fuel for 1 unit. But since each plane can carry only 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled.

The classic solution involves multiple planes assisting by transferring fuel. Let me think step by step.

Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C. All start together. They fly together for a certain distance, then some planes transfer fuel and return, while others continue.

Let me try with three planes. Let's say they fly together for distance d. Each plane uses d fuel. So each has 0.5 - d fuel left.

At this point, planes B and C can transfer some fuel to plane A, then return to the island. But how much fuel can they transfer?

Plane B and C need to have enough fuel to return to the island. The distance back is d, so each needs d fuel. So the amount of fuel they can give to plane A is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d.

So each of B and C can give 0.5 - 2d fuel to A. So total fuel given to A would be 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d.

But plane A already has 0.5 - d fuel left. So total fuel in A after receiving is (0.5 - d) + (1 - 4d) = 1.5 - 5d.

Plane A needs to have enough fuel to go the remaining distance. The total distance is 1, and they've already gone d, so remaining is 1 - d. So 1.5 - 5d must be ≥ 1 - d → 1.5 -5d ≥ 1 -d → 0.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ 0.125.

So if d is 0.125, then:

Fuel given by B and C: 0.5 - 2*(0.125) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 each. So total 0.5.

Plane A's fuel after transfer: 0.5 - 0.125 + 0.5 = 0.875.

Plane A needs to go 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 distance. So exactly enough. So plane A can make it to the halfway point, but wait, the total distance is 1. Wait, no, the total distance around the world is 1. So if the plane starts at the airport, goes d=0.125, then gets 0.875 fuel, which allows it to go 0.875 distance. So total distance would be 0.125 + 0.875 = 1.0. So that works. But then, after that, plane A would have zero fuel. Wait, but the problem says the plane must get all the way around the world. Wait, but if plane A reaches the end, it's done. But the problem says all planes must return safely. Wait, but in this scenario, plane A is the one going around, and planes B and C return. So plane A is the one that needs to go around, but how does it return? Wait, no, the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world", but the question is about getting one plane around the world, and all planes must return safely. Wait, but if plane A goes around the world, it would have to return, right? Because the problem says all planes must return safely. Wait, but the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world" but then all planes must return. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the problem is that the plane that goes around the world doesn't need to return? Or maybe the question is that the plane goes around the world and returns? Wait, the wording says "get one airplane all the way around the world", which is a full circle, so it must return to the airport. So all planes, including the one that goes around, must return.

Wait, that complicates things. So the plane that goes around the world must return, so it needs fuel for the entire trip. So the total fuel required is for going around the world (distance 1) and returning (another 1), but that's a total of 2 units. But each plane can carry 0.5 units. So that's impossible unless they have multiple refuels.

Wait, but the problem says the plane can fly exactly 1/2 way around the world on a full tank. So maybe the total distance around the world is 1 unit, so each plane can fly 0.5 units on a full tank. So to go around the world (distance 1), the plane would need two full tanks, but it can't carry that. Hence, the need for other planes to help carry fuel.

But the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world", which is a full circle, so the plane must return. So the total distance is 1 unit (around the world), and the plane needs to have enough fuel for that trip. But each plane can only carry enough for 0.5 units. So the plane needs to be refueled mid-flight.

But how? Let me think again. Let's consider that the plane needs to have fuel for the entire trip. So maybe multiple planes help carry fuel to the main plane at various points.

In the classic problem where planes can refuel and return, the minimum number of planes required is 3. But I need to verify that.

Let me think of the process. Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C. They all start together. They fly together for a certain distance, then B and C transfer fuel to A and return. Then A continues, but maybe needs more help.

Wait, but if A gets enough fuel to go halfway, but then needs to return. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to look up the standard solution, but since I can't do that, I'll try to work it out.

Another approach: The total fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world is 1 unit (distance). But each time a plane helps, it can transfer some fuel. However, each helper plane must also return, so they need to have fuel for their own return trip.

Let me think in terms of fuel consumption. Let's say the main plane needs to have 1 unit of fuel. Each helper plane can carry 0.5 units, but they also need to return, so they can't give all their fuel.

For example, if a helper plane accompanies the main plane for distance d, then returns. The helper plane uses d fuel to go out and d fuel to return, so total 2d. But the helper plane can only carry 0.5 units. Therefore, 2d ≤ 0.5 → d ≤ 0.25. So the helper can go out 0.25 units, transfer some fuel, and return.

So if the helper plane goes out 0.25 units, uses 0.25 fuel, and has 0.25 left. Then, to return, it needs 0.25 fuel. So it can't transfer any fuel. That's not helpful. So maybe two helpers?

Wait, maybe multiple helpers can meet at a point and transfer fuel. Let's consider three planes. All three start together. They fly for a distance d. Each uses d fuel. Now, they have 0.5 - d fuel left. At this point, two planes (say B and C) can transfer fuel to plane A, then return. How much can they transfer?

Each of B and C needs to have enough fuel to return. The distance back is d, so they need d fuel. So each of B and C can give up to (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d fuel to plane A.

So total fuel given to A is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d.

Plane A's fuel after transfer is (0.5 - d) + (1 - 4d) = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, plane A needs to have enough fuel to go the remaining distance. The total distance is 1, so after flying d, the remaining is 1 - d. So 1.5 - 5d ≥ 1 - d → 0.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ 0.125.

So if d is 0.125, then:

Fuel given by B and C: 0.5 - 2*(0.125) = 0.25 each. Total 0.5.

Plane A's fuel after transfer: 0.5 - 0.125 + 0.5 = 0.875.

Plane A needs to go 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 distance. So exactly enough. So plane A can make it to the end of the journey, but then how does it return? Wait, the problem says all planes must return safely. So plane A must return as well. So this approach only gets plane A halfway? No, wait, the total distance is 1, so if plane A goes 0.125, then gets 0.875 fuel, which allows it to go 0.875 distance. So total distance is 0.125 + 0.875 = 1.0. So plane A reaches the destination, but then needs to return. But it has no fuel left. So this doesn't work.

Ah, right! So the problem is that the main plane needs to go around the world and return. So the total distance is 2 units (there and back), but the plane can only carry 0.5 units. So the main plane needs to be refueled multiple times.

This complicates things. So maybe the solution requires multiple stages of refueling.

Let me think of the problem as needing to get the main plane to have enough fuel for the entire trip. Let's consider that the main plane needs to have fuel for the entire 1 unit trip around the world. But since it can't carry enough, other planes help by transferring fuel at various points.

This is similar to the classic "jeep problem" where a jeep needs to cross a desert with multiple trips to cache fuel. But in this case, the planes can fly in formation and transfer fuel mid-air.

In the classic problem with multiple planes, the minimum number required is 3. But I need to check the steps again.

Let me try with three planes again, but this time considering that the main plane needs to return. Wait, but if the main plane needs to go around the world and return, that's a total of 2 units. So the fuel required is 2 units. But each plane can carry 0.5 units. So the total fuel needed is 2 units, but the planes can carry 0.5 units each. So how many planes are needed?

But the planes can help by transferring fuel. Let me think of the process as multiple stages.

First, all planes fly together for a certain distance, then some planes transfer fuel and return, while others continue. Then, the remaining planes repeat the process.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to find a known solution. From what I remember, the answer is 3 planes. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, maybe it's 5 planes. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: Each time a plane helps, it can provide fuel to the main plane. But since all planes must return, the fuel they provide is limited.

Let me consider that to get the main plane around the world, it needs to have fuel for the entire trip. Let's say the main plane needs to have fuel for 1 unit. Each helper plane can contribute some fuel, but they also need to return.

Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C. All start together. They fly for a distance d. At this point, each has used d fuel, so they have 0.5 - d left.

Now, planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return. The amount they can transfer is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d each. So total transferred to A is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d.

Plane A now has 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d fuel.

Now, plane A needs to go the remaining distance (1 - d) and then return. Wait, no, the total trip is around the world, which is 1 unit. So if plane A is at distance d from the start, it needs to go 1 - d more to complete the circle. But then it needs to return, which is another 1 unit. Wait, no, the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world", which is a full circle. So the plane needs to go from the airport, fly around the world, and return to the airport. So the total distance is 2 units (there and back). But each plane can only carry 0.5 units of fuel. So the main plane needs to have enough fuel for 2 units, but it can only carry 0.5. Hence, the need for help.

So let's adjust the previous calculation. The main plane needs to go 1 unit (around the world) and then return 1 unit. Total 2 units. But with help from other planes.

Let me try with three planes again. Suppose they fly together for distance d. Then planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return.

Plane A now has 1.5 - 5d fuel. This fuel needs to be enough for the remaining distance to go around the world and return. Wait, but after flying d, the plane has to go 1 - d to complete the circle, then 1 unit to return. Total of 2 - d units. So 1.5 - 5d ≥ 2 - d → 1.5 - 5d ≥ 2 - d → -1.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ -0.375. Which is impossible. So this approach isn't working.

Hmm, I must be misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport."

So the main plane needs to go around the world (distance 1), and return to the airport. So total distance is 2 units. But each plane can only carry 0.5 units of fuel. So the main plane needs to have enough fuel for 2 units. But with help from other planes.

Let me think of the problem as needing to have fuel at various points along the journey. For example, if we have multiple planes that can meet the main plane at certain points and transfer fuel.

Let me consider the classic problem where the minimum number is 3. But I need to see how that works.

Another approach: The total amount of fuel needed for the main plane to go around the world and return is 2 units. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. But the other planes can help by carrying extra fuel to the main plane.

However, each helper plane must also return to the airport, so they need to have fuel for their own trips.

Let me think of it as multiple trips. For example, if a helper plane flies out with the main plane for a distance, transfers some fuel, and returns. The fuel transferred is the amount that the helper can give without needing to carry extra fuel for their return.

Let me try with two helper planes. Suppose the main plane is accompanied by two helpers. They all start together. They fly together for distance d. Each uses d fuel. Now, the helpers can transfer fuel to the main plane and return.

Each helper has 0.5 - d fuel left. To return, they need d fuel. So they can transfer (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d fuel to the main plane.

So two helpers can transfer 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d fuel to the main plane.

The main plane has 0.5 - d fuel from its own tank plus the transferred fuel, so total is 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, the main plane needs to have enough fuel to go the remaining distance to complete the circle and return. The remaining distance is 1 - d (to complete the circle) plus 1 (to return), totaling 2 - d. So 1.5 - 5d ≥ 2 - d → 1.5 -5d ≥ 2 -d → -1.5 ≥ 4d → d ≤ -0.375. Which is impossible. So this approach doesn't work with two helpers.

Now, let's try with three helpers. So four planes: main, A, B, C. They all start together. They fly for distance d. Each uses d fuel. Now, planes A, B, and C can transfer fuel to the main plane and return.

Each of A, B, C has 0.5 - d fuel left. To return, they need d fuel, so they can transfer (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d each. Total transferred is 3*(0.5 - 2d) = 1.5 - 6d.

Main plane's fuel after transfer: 0.5 - d + 1.5 - 6d = 2 - 7d.

Now, the main plane needs to have enough fuel for the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 1 - d (to complete the circle) + 1 (to return) = 2 - d. So 2 - 7d ≥ 2 - d → -7d ≥ -d → -6d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 0. Which is impossible. So this also doesn't work.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of it as multiple stages where planes help at different points.

In the classic problem, the solution involves multiple planes helping at different points. For example, planes help each other at certain distances, transferring fuel and returning. This is similar to the problem of crossing a desert with multiple trips.

Let me think of the problem as needing to have fuel caches at certain points. For example, if you have planes that can carry fuel to a certain point, then return, allowing the main plane to have more fuel.

Let me try with three planes again, but this time considering that the main plane needs to go halfway and then return, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the problem states that the main plane needs to go all the way around the world, which is a full circle. So it's not just halfway. So the main plane needs to have enough fuel for the entire trip.

Another idea: The total fuel required for the main plane to go around the world and return is 2 units. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. So the total fuel needed is 2 units. However, each helper plane can contribute some fuel, but they also need to return. So the total fuel available from all planes is the number of planes multiplied by 0.5 units. But since the main plane is using some of that fuel, we need to calculate how many planes are needed.

But this is too vague. Let me think of it in terms of fuel transfer.

Suppose we have n planes. They all start together. They fly for distance d, then some planes transfer fuel and return, while others continue. The process is repeated until the main plane has enough fuel.

Let me try with three planes again, but this time considering that after the first transfer, the main plane needs more help.

First, three planes (A, B, C) start together. They fly for distance d. Each uses d fuel, so they have 0.5 - d left.

Now, planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return. As before, each can transfer 0.5 - 2d fuel. Total transferred is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d. Main plane A now has 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, plane A needs to continue. Let's say it flies another distance e. It uses e fuel, so it has 1.5 - 5d - e fuel left. Then, it needs to return, which is another distance of (d + e) to go back? No, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe after the first transfer, plane A has enough fuel to go to the halfway point and then get help again. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the solution is 3 planes, but I'm missing something in the calculation. Let me try with d = 1/8 (0.125).

At d = 0.125, the transferred fuel is 1 - 4*(0.125) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. So main plane A has 1.5 - 5*(0.125) = 1.5 - 0.625 = 0.875 fuel.

Now, plane A needs to go the remaining distance to complete the circle and return. Let's see, after flying 0.125, it needs to go 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 to complete the circle, then 1 to return. Total of 1.875 units. But it only has 0.875 fuel, which is not enough. So this doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe the solution involves multiple stages with more planes. Let me think of the classic problem where the answer is 3 planes. Maybe I'm missing that the main plane doesn't need to return, but the problem states all planes must return. Wait, the problem says "get one airplane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport." So the main plane must return as well. So it's a round trip.

This seems extremely challenging. Maybe the answer is 3 planes, but I'm not seeing the steps. Let me try to think of it as needing to have enough fuel at the halfway point.

If the main plane needs to go halfway (0.5 units) and then return, but that's not the case here. Wait, the problem is to go all the way around the world, which is a full circle. So it's 1 unit, and the plane needs to return, making it 2 units total.

Let me think of it as needing to have fuel at the halfway point. Suppose we have planes that help carry fuel to the halfway point, then return.

For example, if a plane flies to the halfway point, transfers some fuel, and returns. The fuel needed for that trip is 0.5 units out and 0.5 units back, total 1 unit. But the plane can only carry 0.5 units. So it can't do that alone. So it needs help from other planes.

This is similar to the problem where you need multiple planes to carry fuel to a certain point.

Let me try with three planes again. All three start together. They fly to a point d, transfer fuel, and return. Let's say they fly to d, transfer fuel, and return. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. Let's say they fly to d, then transfer fuel to the main plane, and return.

But this is getting too vague. I think I need to look up the standard solution, but since I can't, I'll try to recall that the minimum number is 3 planes for a round trip. However, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might be 5 planes.

Wait, I remember that in the classic problem where a plane needs to fly around the world with multiple planes, the minimum number is 3. But I'm not sure. Let me think of it as follows:

The main plane needs to have enough fuel for the entire trip. Let's say it gets help from two other planes at certain points.

First, all three planes fly together for a distance d. At this point, each has used d fuel. Now, the two helper planes transfer fuel to the main plane and return. The amount they can transfer is (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d each. Total transferred is 2*(0.5 - 2d) = 1 - 4d. Main plane now has 0.5 - d + 1 - 4d = 1.5 - 5d.

Now, the main plane needs to continue. Let's say it flies another distance e, using e fuel. So it has 1.5 - 5d - e fuel left. Then, it needs to return, which is a distance of (d + e) to go back? No, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, after the first transfer, the main plane has 1.5 - 5d fuel. Let's set this equal to the fuel needed to go the remaining distance and return. The remaining distance to complete the circle is 1 - d, and then return is 1 unit. Total is 2 - d. So 1.5 - 5d = 2 - d → 1.5 - 5d = 2 - d → -1.5 = 4d → d = -0.375, which is impossible.

This suggests that with three planes, it's not possible. Maybe more planes are needed.

Let me try with four planes. Let's say the main plane is accompanied by three helpers. They all start together, fly for distance d. Each uses d fuel, so they have 0.5 - d left. Now, the three helpers can transfer fuel to the main plane and return.

Each helper can transfer (0.5 - d) - d = 0.5 - 2d. Total transferred is 3*(0.5 - 2d) = 1.5 - 6d.

Main plane now has 0.5 - d + 1.5 - 6d = 2 - 7d.

This needs to be enough for the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 2 - d (as before). So 2 - 7d ≥ 2 - d → -7d ≥ -d → -6d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 0. Still impossible.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe the approach is wrong. Perhaps the main plane needs to be assisted at multiple points.

Let me think of it in stages. Suppose the main plane needs to go from the airport to a point A, then to a point B, then to the destination, and then back. At each point, other planes help by transferring fuel.

For example, let's say we have three planes: A, B, and C.

First, all three fly together to point A, which is 1/8 of the way around the world (distance d = 1/8). Each uses 1/8 fuel, so they have 0.5 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel left.

At point A, planes B and C transfer fuel to A and return. Each of B and C needs to have enough fuel to return to the airport, which is 1/8 distance back. So they need 1/8 fuel. Each has 3/8 fuel, so they can transfer 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel to plane A. Total transferred is 2*(1/4) = 1/2.

Plane A now has its original 3/8 + 1/2 = 3/8 + 4/8 = 7/8 fuel.

Now, plane A continues from point A to the halfway point (distance 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8). It uses 3/8 fuel, leaving it with 7/8 - 3/8 = 4/8 = 1/2 fuel.

At the halfway point, another plane (let's say plane D) meets plane A and transfers fuel. Plane D has flown from the airport to the halfway point, using 1/2 fuel, so it has 0.5 - 1/2 = 0 fuel left. That doesn't help. So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe more planes are needed at the halfway point. Let's say two planes help at the halfway point.

But this is getting too complex. I think I need to recall that the answer is 3 planes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be 5 planes.

Wait, I found a reference in my mind that for a round trip, the minimum number is 3 planes. Let me try to think of it as follows:

Three planes start together. They fly 1/8 of the way. Each uses 1/8 fuel, leaving 3/8. Two of them transfer 1/4 fuel each to the third, then return. The third plane now has 3/8 + 2*(1/4) = 3/8 + 1/2 = 7/8 fuel. It then continues to the 1/2 mark, using 3/8 fuel, leaving 7/8 - 3/8 = 1/2. At the 1/2 mark, it needs to continue, but it has 1/2 fuel. To go the remaining 1/2 distance to complete the circle and return, it needs 1 unit. So it's short. But another plane could help here.

Wait, maybe the third plane is now at the 1/2 mark with 1/2 fuel. It needs to go 1/2 more to complete the circle and then 1 unit to return. Total of 1.5 units. It only has 1/2. So it needs more help.

Another plane could fly to the 1/2 mark, transfer fuel, and return. Let's say a fourth plane flies to the 1/2 mark. It uses 1/2 fuel, leaving 0.5 - 1/2 = 0. So it can't transfer anything. Not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. I think I need to conclude that the minimum number is 3 planes, even though my calculations aren't showing it, but I might be missing something. Alternatively, the answer is 5 planes.

Wait, another approach: Each time a plane helps, it can provide a certain amount of fuel. For the main plane to go around the world, it needs 2 units of fuel (since it's a round trip). Each helper plane can provide 0.5 units of fuel, but they also need to return, so they can only contribute a portion.

Let me think of it as needing to have 2 units of fuel for the main plane. Each helper plane can contribute some amount. Let's say n helper planes are used. Each can contribute
