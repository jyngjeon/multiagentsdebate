Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 9. Extracted: {"reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement one by one given that \( P \) is a linear transformation satisfying \( P^2 = P \).

I. P is invertible.
- If \( P \) were invertible, then \( P^{-1} \) would exist, and multiplying both sides of \( P^2 = P \) by \( P^{-1} \) from the left would yield \( P = I \). This means \( P \) must be the identity transformation to be invertible. However, it can also be other transformations like projections which are not invertible. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.

II. P is diagonalizable.
- Since \( P^2 = P \), we know that \( P \) is a projection matrix. Projection matrices are diagonalizable because they have eigenvalues that are either 0 or 1, which means they can be represented in a diagonal form with these eigenvalues on the diagonal. Therefore, this statement is true.

III. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.
- Although \( P \) could be the identity transformation (\( I \)) or the zero transformation (\( 0 \)), there are other possibilities, such as projections onto a subspace, which do not satisfy being only the identity or the zero transformation. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.

Thus, the only statement that must be true is II.", "answer": "C"}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 54. Extracted: {"reasoning": "To find the area of an equilateral triangle given the radius of its inscribed circle, we can use the relationship between the side length \( s \) of the equilateral triangle and the radius \( r \) of its inscribed circle. The formula relating these is \( r = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\). Given that \( r = 2 \\), we solve for \( s \\):\n\n1. Start with the formula: \( r = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{6} \).
2. Substitute \( r = 2 \): \( 2 = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{6} \).
3. Solve for \( s \\): \( s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} = 4\\sqrt{3} \\).

Next, we calculate the area \( A \\) of the equilateral triangle using the formula \( A = \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\):

1. Substitute \( s = 4\\sqrt{3} \\): \( A = \\frac{(4\\sqrt{3})^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{48\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 12\\sqrt{3} \\).
