  "reasoning": "To find the product of the magnitudes of two complex numbers, we first need to calculate each magnitude separately. The magnitude of a complex number \(a + bi\) is given by \\(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\). Therefore, for the first complex number \(9i - 12 = -12 + 9i\\), its magnitude is \\(|-12 + 9i| = \sqrt{(-12)^2 + 9^2} = \sqrt{144 + 81} = \sqrt{225} = 15\\). For the second complex number \(3 + 4i\\), its magnitude is \\(|3 + 4i| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\\). Multiplying these magnitudes together gives us \\(15 \cdot 5 = 75\\).",

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 3. Extracted: {array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 6 & 6 & 5 & 1_b \\ + & & & 1 & 1 & 5_b \\ \cline{1-6} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 6 & 6_b\\ \end{array} \]

First, let's convert each number from base \( b \) to base 10:

1. Convert \( 6651_b \) to base 10:
\[ 6651_b = 6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1 \]

2. Convert \( 115_b \) to base 10:
\[ 115_b = 1b^2 + 1b + 5 \]

3. Convert \( 10066_b \) to base 10:
\[ 10066_b = 1b^4 + 0b^3 + 0b^2 + 6b + 6 \]

Now, set up the equation in base 10:
\[ (6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1) + (b^2 + b + 5) = b^4 + 6b + 6 \]

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[ 6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 = b^4 + 6b + 6 \]

Subtract \( b^4 + 6b + 6 \) from both sides:
\[ 6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 - b^4 - 6b - 6 = 0 \]
\[ -b^4 + 6b^3 + 7b^2 = 0 \]

Factor out \( b^2 \):
\[ b^2(-b^2 + 6b + 7) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ b^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -b^2 + 6b + 7 = 0 \]

Since \( b \neq 0 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -b^2 + 6b + 7 = 0 \]

Multiply through by -1:
\[ b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \]

Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \):
\[ A = 1, B = -6, C = -7 \]
\[ b = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 28}}{2} \]
\[ b = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2} \]
\[ b = \frac{6 \pm 8}{2} \]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[ b = \frac{6 + 8}{2} = 7 \]
\[ b = \frac{6 - 8}{2} = -1 \]

Since \( b \) must be a positive integer greater than the largest digit used (which is 6), we have:
\[ b = 7 \]

Thus, the base \( b \) is:
\[ \boxed{7}

  "reasoning": "Given that two positive prime numbers are roots of the equation \(x^2 - 12x + k = 0\), we can use Vieta's formulas which state that for a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) with roots \(p\) and \(q\), the sum of the roots \(p + q = -\\frac{b}{a}\) and the product of the roots \(pq = \\frac{c}{a}\). In our case, the equation is \(x^2 - 12x + k = 0\), so \(a = 1\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = k\). Therefore, the sum of the roots is \(p + q = 12\) and the product of the roots is \(pq = k\). We need to find two prime numbers whose sum is 12. Checking pairs of primes, we find that the only pair that satisfies this condition is 5 and 7 (since \(5 + 7 = 12\)).

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 11. Extracted: {\text{small}} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi \]

The area of the larger circle is:
\[ A_{\text{large}} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi \]

Given that the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, the area of the shaded region is:
\[ A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]

Now, let’s denote the central angle \(\angle ADC\) as \(\theta\) (in radians). The area of the sector of the larger circle corresponding to \(\theta\) is:
\[ A_{\text{sector, large}} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta \]

Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle corresponding to \(\theta\) is:
\[ A_{\text{sector, small}} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2} \]

The shaded region consists of the difference between the sectors of the larger and smaller circles:
\[ A_{\text{shaded}} = 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2} \]

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]

Solving for \(\theta\):
\[ 3\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3} \]
\[ \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \]

Converting \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:
\[ \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{1800^\circ}{9} = 200^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[ \boxed{200}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 16. Extracted: { cm}$, $AD = 30 \text{ cm}$, and $BE = 20 \text{ cm}$, we can determine the positions of points $A$, $B$, $D$, and $E$ on the number line.

- Let's place point $A$ at the origin, so $A = 0$.
- Since $AE = 40 \text{ cm}$, point $E$ will be at $40$.
- Given $AD = 30 \text{ cm}$, point $D$ will be at $30$.
- Since $BE = 20 \text{ cm}$ and point $E$ is at $40$, point $B$ will be at $40 - 20 = 20$.

Now, $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$. The coordinates of $B$ and $D$ are $20$ and $30$, respectively. Therefore, the coordinate of $C$ is:
\[
C = \frac{B + D}{2} = \frac{20 + 30}{2} = 25
\]

To find the distance $AC$, we calculate the absolute difference between the coordinates of $A$ and $C$:
\[
AC = |A - C| = |0 - 25| = 25 \text{ cm}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Therefore, $|z_2^4z_1^2| = 1$. Since $z_1$ and $z_2$ are not real, let's denote $z_1 = r_1e^{i\theta_1}$ and $z_2 = r_2e^{i\theta_2}$ where $r_1, r_2 > 0$ and $\theta_1, \theta_2 \in [0, 2\pi)$.

This implies that the argument of $z_{n+3}/z_n^2$ is an integer multiple of $\pi$. Thus, $z_{n+3}/z_n^2 = re^{i(k\pi)}$ for some real $r$ and integer $k$. Specifically, for $n=1$,\n\n- $\dfrac{z_4}{z_1^2} = \dfrac{z_2^5z_1^2}{z_1^2} = z_2^5 = re^{i(k\pi)}$\n\nTherefore, $5\theta_2 + k\pi = m\pi$ for some integer $m$, which means $5\theta_2 = (m-k)\pi$. Hence, $\theta_2 = \dfrac{(m-k)\pi}{5}$. Similarly, $7\theta_2 + 3\theta_1 = n\pi$ for some integer $n$, leading to $\theta_1 = \dfrac{n\pi - 7\theta_2}{3}$. Considering the modulus condition $r_2^4r_1^2 = 1$, we find that the possible values of $z_1$ are determined by the angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ satisfying these conditions. The product of all possible values of $z_1$ is then found by considering the symmetry and periodicity of the trigonometric functions involved, leading to the result.",

  "reasoning": "We can represent the given equations in terms of complex numbers. Let \( z = a + bi \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit. Then, we have the equation \( z + \\frac{17z - 6i\\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = 6 \), where \( \\overline{z} = a - bi \\) is the conjugate of \( z \\). Simplifying, we get \( z + \\frac{17(a+bi) - 6i(a-bi)}{a^2+b^2} = 6 \\).

Now, we can perform the arithmetic operation in base 10:
\[ 16 + 71 - 45 - 67 \]

Let's simplify step-by-step:
\[ 16 + 71 = 87 \]
\[ 87 - 45 = 42 \]
\[ 42 - 67 = -25 \]

The result is $-25_{10}$. Since negative numbers in base 3 are not typically expressed directly but rather as complements or other representations, we'll express it as a positive equivalent in base 3 if needed. However, for simplicity, we will just state the negative value.

Converting $-25_{10}$ to base 3:
\[ -25_{10} = - (2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0) = -221_3 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ -221_3 \]

However, since the problem asks for a positive representation, we can leave it as a negative or provide the positive complement if required. Here, we will provide the direct negative form as per the calculation.

  "reasoning": "We start with the equation given: \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 = d + 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}\\). To simplify, we can isolate the square root term and square both sides to eliminate it. Let's denote the expression inside the square root as \(x\), so that \(x = 10a + 14b + 22c - d\\) and the equation becomes \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 = d + 36\\sqrt{x}\\).

This can be expressed as:
\[ P_b \times P_b = 31_b \]

First, convert these numbers from base \( b \) to base 10:

1. \( P_b \) in base 10 is simply \( P \).
2. \( 31_b \) in base 10 is:
   \[ 3b + 1 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ P \times P = 3b + 1 \]
\[ P^2 = 3b + 1 \]

We also know that \( P \) is one less than \( b \):
\[ P = b - 1 \]

Substitute \( P = b - 1 \) into the equation:
\[ (b - 1)^2 = 3b + 1 \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ b^2 - 2b + 1 = 3b + 1 \]
\[ b^2 - 2b + 1 - 3b - 1 = 0 \]
\[ b^2 - 5b = 0 \]

Factor out \( b \):
\[ b(b - 5) = 0 \]

Since \( b \neq 0 \), we have:
\[ b - 5 = 0 \]
\[ b = 5 \]

Thus, the base \( b \) is:

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 55. Extracted: {pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, compute the square of the matrix on the left-hand side:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We equate this result with the right-hand side matrix:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

This gives us four equations by comparing corresponding entries:

1. \( a^2 + bc = c \)
2. \( ab + bd = a \)
3. \( ac + dc = d \)
4. \( bc + d^2 = b \)

Let's analyze these equations step by step.

### Equation 1: \( a^2 + bc = c \)
Rearrange it as:
\[ a^2 + bc - c = 0 \]
\[ a^2 + c(b-1) = 0 \]
\[ c(b-1) = -a^2 \]

If \( b \neq 1 \), then:
\[ c = -\frac{a^2}{b-1}. \]

If \( b = 1 \), then:
\[ a^2 = 0 \implies a = 0. \]

### Equation 2: \( ab + bd = a \)
Factor out \( b \):
\[ b(a + d) = a \]

If \( b \neq 0 \), then:
\[ a + d = \frac{a}{b} \]
\[ d = \frac{a}{b} - a \]
\[ d = a \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right). \]

If \( b = 0 \), then:
\[ a = 0. \]

### Equation 3: \( ac + dc = d \)
Factor out \( c \):
\[ c(a + d) = d \]

If \( c \neq 0 \), then:
\[ a + d = \frac{d}{c} \]
\[ d = \frac{d}{c} - a \]
\[ d = a \left( \frac{1}{c} - 1 \right). \]

If \( c = 0 \), then:
\[ d = 0. \]

### Equation 4: \( bc + d^2 = b \)
Rearrange it as:
\[ bc + d^2 - b = 0 \]
\[ b(c-1) + d^2 = 0 \]

If \( b \neq 0 \), then:
\[ c - 1 = -\frac{d^2}{b} \]
\[ c = 1 - \frac{d^2}{b}. \]

If \( b = 0 \), then:
\[ d^2 = 0 \implies d = 0. \]

### Case Analysis

#### Case 1: \( b = 1 \)
From Equation 1:
\[ c = -a^2. \]
From Equation 2:
\[ a + d = a \implies d = 0. \]
From Equation 3:
\[ ac + dc = d \implies -a^3 = 0 \implies a = 0. \]
From Equation 4:
\[ c + d^2 = 1 \implies -a^2 = 1 \implies 0 = 1 \text{ (contradiction)}. \]

Thus, no solutions in this case.

#### Case 2: \( b = 0 \)
From Equation 1:
\[ a^2 = c. \]
From Equation 2:
\[ a = 0 \implies d = 0. \]
From Equation 3:
\[ ac + dc = d \implies 0 = 0. \]
From Equation 4:
\[ c = 0 \implies a^2 = 0 \implies a = 0. \]

Thus, one solution is \( (0, 0, 0, 0) \).

#### Case 3: \( b \neq 0, 1 \)
From Equation 1:
\[ c = -\frac{a^2}{b-1}. \]
From Equation 2:
\[ d = a \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right). \]
From Equation 3:
\[ c(a + d) = d \implies -\frac{a^2}{b-1}(a + a \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right)) = a \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right) \]
\[ -\frac{a^2}{b-1} \cdot a \left( \frac{1}{b} \right) = a \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right) \]
\[ -\frac{a^3}{b(b-1)} = a \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right) \]
\[ -\frac{a^2}{b(b-1)} = \frac{1}{b} - 1 \]
\[ -\frac{a^2}{b(b-1)} = \frac{1 - b}{b} \]
\[ -a^2 = (1 - b)(b-1) \]
\[ -a^2 = -(b-1)^2 \]
\[ a^2 = (b-1)^2 \]
\[ a = b-1 \text{ or } a = 1-b. \]

For \( a = b-1 \):
\[ c = -\frac{(b-1)^2}{b-1} = -(b-1) = 1-b. \]
\[ d = (b-1) \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right) = (b-1) \left( \frac{1-b}{b} \right) = \frac{(b-1)(1-b)}{b} = \frac{-(b-1)^2}{b} = -\frac{(b-1)^2}{b}. \]

For \( a = 1-b \):
\[ c = -\frac{(1-b)^2}{b-1} = -(1-b) = b-1. \]
\[ d = (1-b) \left( \frac{1}{b} - 1 \right) = (1-b) \left( \frac{1-b}{b} \right) = \frac{(1-b)^2}{b}. \]

Both cases give valid solutions. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

  "reasoning": "Let's denote the smaller perfect square as \(a^2\) and the larger one as \(b^2\), where \(b > a\). We know that the difference between these squares is 99, so we have \(b^2 - a^2 = 99\). This can be factored into \((b-a)(b+a) = 99\). Since there are exactly two other perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\), it means \(b^2 - a^2 = (k+1)^2 - k^2 + (k+2)^2 - (k+1)^2 + (k+3)^2 - (k+2)^2 = 3(2k+3)\) for some integer \(k\). Simplifying gives us \(b^2 - a^2 = 6k + 9\). Comparing with our original equation, we get \(6k + 9 = 99\), which simplifies to \(6k = 90\) or \(k = 15\).

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 68. Extracted: {\frac{m\pi}{n}} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers with \( m < n \).

Given:
\[ z^{13} = w \]
\[ w^{11} = z \]

Substitute \( w = z^{13} \) into the second equation:
\[ (z^{13})^{11} = z \]
\[ z^{143} = z \]

Since \( z \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( z \):
\[ z^{142} = 1 \]

This implies that \( z \) is a 142nd root of unity. The 142nd roots of unity are given by:
\[ z = e^{2k\pi i / 142} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 141 \]

We need to determine the imaginary part of \( z \). For \( z = e^{2k\pi i / 142} \), the imaginary part is:
\[ \text{Im}(z) = \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{142}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{71}\right) \]

Given that the imaginary part of \( z \) is \( \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right) \), we identify:
\[ \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{71}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right) \]

Thus, \( n = 71 \) since \( \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{71}\right) \) matches the form \( \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( n = 71 \).

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 87. Extracted: {10^9}{k}\) is less than \(\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\).

First, recall the definition of binomial coefficients:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

We need to compare:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}
\]

Using the definition of binomial coefficients, we have:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} = \frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!}
\]
and
\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Rewriting the inequality:
\[
\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!} = \frac{(10^9 + 1) \cdot 10^9!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1) \cdot 10^9!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Cancel out \(10^9!\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Rewrite the factorials:
\[
\frac{1}{k \cdot (k-1)!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)!}
\]

Cancel out \((k-1)!\):
\[
\frac{1}{k(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)!}
\]

Since \((10^9 + 1 - k)! = (10^9 + 1 - k)(10^9 - k)!\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{k(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)(10^9 - k)!}
\]

Cancel out \((10^9 - k)!\):
\[
\frac{1}{k} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)}
\]

Multiply both sides by \(k(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)\):
\[
(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k) < k(10^9 + 1)
\]

Expand and simplify:
\[
(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k) = 10^{18} + 3 \cdot 10^9 + 2 - 2 \cdot 10^9 - 3k + k^2
\]
\[
= 10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < k(10^9 + 1)
\]
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < 10^9k + k
\]
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < 10^9k + k
\]
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 < 10^9k + 4k - k^2
\]

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 89. Extracted: {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ where $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = -8$:
\[ c = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 32}}{2} \]
\[ c = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} \]
\[ c = \frac{7 \pm 9}{2} \]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[ c = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad c = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \]

Since $c$ must be a positive integer, we have:
\[ c = 8 \]

Substituting back to find $b$:
\[ b = c + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \]

     - Numbers less than or equal to 6: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
     - 1 and 5 are coprime with 6.
     - List: \(\{1, 5\}\)
     - Count: 2

   - **Factor 12:**
     - Numbers less than or equal to 12: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\)
     - 1, 5, 7, and 11 are coprime with 12.
     - List: \(\{1, 5, 7, 11\}\)
     - Count: 4

3. **Summarize Total Counts:**
   - Sum up all counts from each factor:
     \[
     1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12
     \]

Thus, the total number of numbers Ezekiel writes is:
