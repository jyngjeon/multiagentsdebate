Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 3. Extracted: {"reasoning": "To find the base \( b \\) such that the given addition problem is correct, we need to convert all numbers from base \( b \\) to base 10 and then perform the addition in base 10. We will then check if the result matches the sum provided in base \( b \\).\n\nFirst, let's convert each number to base 10:\n- \( 6651_b = 6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1 \\)\n- \( 115_b = 1b^2 + 1b + 5 \\)\n- \( 10066_b = b^4 + 6b + 6 \\)\n\nNext, we set up the equation based on the given addition problem:\n\[ (6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1) + (b^2 + b + 5) = b^4 + 6b + 6 \\]\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\[ 6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 = b^4 + 6b + 6 \\]\nSubtract \( 6b + 6 \\) from both sides:\n\[ 6b^3 + 7b^2 = b^4 \\]\nRearrange the equation:\n\[ b^4 - 6b^3 - 7b^2 = 0 \\]\nFactor out \( b^2 \\):\n\[ b^2(b^2 - 6b - 7) = 0 \\]\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\[ b^2 = 0 \\quad \text{or} \\quad b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \\]\nSince \( b \\neq 0 \\), we solve the quadratic equation:\n\[ b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \\]\nUsing the quadratic formula \( b = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \\) where \( A = 1 \\), \( B = -6 \\), and \( C = -7 \\):\n\[ b = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 28}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 8}{2} \\]\nThus, we have two potential solutions:\n\[ b = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1 \\]\nSince \( b \\) must be a positive integer greater than the largest digit used in the problem (which is 6), we discard \( b = -1 \\) and accept \( b = 7 \\).", "answer": 7}

  "reasoning": "To solve this, we first recognize that triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 6\), \(BC = 8\), and \(CA = 10\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(B\). This can be verified using the Pythagorean theorem: \(6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 10^2\).\n\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that if \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), then it divides the opposite side \(BC\) into segments proportional to the adjacent sides, i.e., \(BD/DC = AB/AC = 6/10 = 3/5\).\n\nLet \(BD = 3x\) and \(DC = 5x\). Since \(BD + DC = BC = 8\), we have \(3x + 5x = 8\), so \(8x = 8\) and thus \(x = 1\). Therefore, \(BD = 3\) and \(DC = 5\).\n\nUsing Stewart's Theorem for the angle bisector in triangle \(ABC\), we have \(AB^2 \cdot DC + AC^2 \cdot BD = AD^2 \cdot BC + BD \cdot DC \cdot BC\).

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {"answer": -4}

To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and derive the necessary relationships between the terms of the sequence.

Given:
1. \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) are not real.
2. \( z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n \) for all integers \( n \geq 1 \).
3. \( \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} \) is real for all integers \( n \geq 1 \).
4. \( \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \).

First, let's express the first few terms in terms of \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \):
\[ z_3 = z_2^2 z_1 \]
\[ z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^4 z_1^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2 \]

Using the fourth condition:
\[ \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2} \right| = \left| \frac{z_1}{z_2^3 z_1} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^3} \right| = 2 \]
Thus,
\[ |z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow |z_2| = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}} \]

Next, consider the second part of the fourth condition:
\[ \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \]
\[ z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{10} z_1^4 z_2^2 z_1 = z_2^{12} z_1^5 \]
So,
\[ \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^{12} z_1^5} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^3} \right| = 2 \]
Thus,
\[ |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]
Since \( |z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \),
\[ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{7}{3}} |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow |z_1|^3 = 2^{\frac{7}{3} - 1} = 2^{\frac{4}{3}} \Rightarrow |z_1| = \sqrt[3]{2^{\frac{4}{3}}} = 2^{\frac{4}{9}} \cdot 2^{\frac{5}{9}} = 2 \]

Now, since \( \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} \) is real, we can write:
\[ \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} = k \in \mathbb{R} \]
For \( n=1 \):
\[ \frac{z_4}{z_1^2} = k \Rightarrow \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_1^2} = k \Rightarrow z_2^5 = k \]
Since \( k \) is real and \( z_2 \) is not real, \( z_2^5 \) must be real, implying that \( z_2 \) lies on the unit circle and its argument is a multiple of \( \frac{2\pi}{5} \).

Considering \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) are not real, and \( |z_1| = 2 \), the possible values for \( z_1 \) are \( 2e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \neq 0, \pi \). Given the symmetry and the modulus constraint, the product of all possible values of \( z_1 \) is:
\[ 2e^{i\theta} \cdot 2e^{-i\theta} = 4 \cdot (-1) = -4 \]

Thus, the product of all possible values of \( z_1 \) is:
\[ \boxed{-4}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 31. Extracted: {"answer": 100}

Explanation:
To solve this, first convert each base 3 number to base 10, perform the arithmetic operations, and then convert the result back to base 3.

- $121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}$
- $2122_3 = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0 = 54 + 9 + 6 + 2 = 71_{10}$
- $1200_3 = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 0 \cdot 3^0 = 27 + 18 + 0 + 0 = 45_{10}$
- $2111_3 = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 54 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 67_{10}$

Now compute the expression in base 10:
$16 + 71 - 45 - 67 = 16 + 71 - 45 - 67 = 87 - 112 = -25_{10}$

Since we need a positive result in base 3, we adjust our approach by recognizing that negative numbers can be handled by adding the modulus of the negative number to the largest subtracted term before converting back:

$-25_{10} + 81_{10} = 56_{10}$ (since $81$ is the next power of $3$ greater than $67$, ensuring we get a positive result).

Finally, convert $56_{10}$ back to base 3:
- $56 / 3 = 18$ remainder $2$
- $18 / 3 = 6$ remainder $0$
- $6 / 3 = 2$ remainder $0$
- $2 / 3 = 0$ remainder $2$

So, $56_{10} = 2002_3$, but since we added an extra $81_{10}$, we need to subtract it back out in base 3 terms which simplifies directly to $100_3$ as the final answer after adjustments. Thus, the answer is {"answer": 100}

  "reasoning": "We start by rearranging the given equation to isolate the square root term on one side:\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - d = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}.\]\nLet's denote $x = 10a + 14b + 22c - d$. Then, we have\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - d = 36 \\sqrt{x}.\]\nSince $x = 10a + 14b + 22c - d$, we can substitute back into the equation to get\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - (10a + 14b + 22c) = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}.\]\nThis simplifies to\n\[a^2 - 10a + b^2 - 14b + c^2 - 22c + 519 = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}.\]\nNow, completing the square for each variable,\n\[(a-5)^2 - 25 + (b-7)^2 - 49 + (c-11)^2 - 121 + 519 = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d},\]\nwhich simplifies to\n\[(a-5)^2 + (b-7)^2 + (c-11)^2 + 324 = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}.\]\nFor the equality to hold, the left side must equal the right side, implying that both sides are perfect squares. This suggests that $(a-5)^2 + (b-7)^2 + (c-11)^2 = 0$ and $36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d} = 324$. The first condition implies $a=5$, $b=7$, and $c=11$. Substituting these values into the second condition gives us\n\[36 \\sqrt{10(5) + 14(7) + 22(11) - d} = 324,\]\nwhich simplifies to\n\[36 \\sqrt{384 - d} = 324.\]\nDividing both sides by 36 yields\n\[\\sqrt{384 - d} = 9,\]\nsquaring both sides results in\n\[384 - d = 81,\]\nso solving for $d$ gives us $d = 303$. Therefore, $a + b + c + d = 5 + 7 + 11 + 303 = 326.$",

We need to find all matrices \(M\) such that \( M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} c & a \\\\ d & b \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nFirst, compute \( M^2 \\):\n\\[ M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\\\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \\end{pmatrix}. \\]\nWe equate this with the given matrix:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\\\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} c & a \\\\ d & b \\end{pmatrix}. \\]\nThis gives us four equations:\n1. \( a^2 + bc = c \\)\n2. \( ab + bd = a \\)\n3. \( ac + dc = d \\)\n4. \( bc + d^2 = b \\)\n\nFrom equation (2), factor out \(b\\) on the left side:\n\\[ b(a + d) = a \\implies b = \\frac{a}{a+d} \\text{ if } a+d \\neq 0. \\]\nFrom equation (4), factor out \(b\\) on the right side:\n\\[ b(c + d) = b \\implies b(c + d - 1) = 0 \\implies b = 0 \\text{ or } c + d = 1. \\]\nIf \(b = 0\\), then from equation (2), we have \(a = 0\\). Substituting \(a = 0\\) and \(b = 0\\) into equations (1) and (3) gives \(c = 0\\) and \(d = 0\\). This yields one solution: \\((0, 0, 0, 0)\\).\n\nIf \(c + d = 1\\), substitute \(c = 1 - d\\) into equations (1) and (3):\n\\[ a^2 + b(1-d) = 1-d \\implies a^2 + b - bd = 1-d \\implies a^2 + b = 1 \\implies b = 1 - a^2. \\]\n\\[ a(1-d) + d^2 = d \\implies a - ad + d^2 = d \\implies a - ad + d^2 - d = 0 \\implies a(1-d) + d(d-1) = 0 \\implies a(1-d) = d(1-d) \\implies (a-d)(1-d) = 0. \\]\nSo, either \(a = d\\) or \(d = 1\\).\n\nIf \(a = d\\), then \(c = 1-a\\) and \(b = 1-a^2\\). Thus, we get solutions of the form \\((a, 1-a^2, 1-a, a)\\) for any real number \(a\\).\n\nIf \(d = 1\\), then \(c = 0\\) and \(b = 1-a^2\\). So, we get solutions of the form \\((a, 1-a^2, 0, 1)\\) for any real number \(a\\).\n\nCombining all solutions, we have infinitely many solutions. However, we need to count distinct ordered quadruples. Each \(a\\) generates a unique quadruple, so there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered quadruples is infinite.", "answer": Infinity}

  "reasoning": "To find the value of \(a\), we start by using the quadratic formula to express the roots of the equation \(ax^2 + 5x - 3 = 0\). The roots are given by:\n\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nFor our equation, \(a = a\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = -3\). Therefore, the roots are:\n\[ x_1 = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{25 + 12a}}{2a}, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-5 - \\sqrt{25 + 12a}}{2a} \\]\nThe absolute value of the difference between these roots is given as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{61}}{3}\\).

  "reasoning": "Let's denote the smaller perfect square as \(a^2\) and the larger one as \(b^2\). Given that the difference between these two squares is 99, we have \(b^2 - a^2 = 99\). This can be factored as \((b-a)(b+a) = 99\). Since there are exactly two other perfect squares between them, it means that the difference between consecutive perfect squares in this range is 1, 3, 5, etc., and thus the difference between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\) should be such that there are exactly two numbers in between. We need to find pairs of factors of 99 that fit this description. The factor pairs of 99 are (1, 99), (3, 33), (9, 11). Only the pair (9, 11) fits because it allows for exactly two other perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\). Solving the system of equations \(b-a=9\) and \(b+a=11\), we get \(b=10\) and \(a=1\). Therefore, the two perfect squares are \(1^2 = 1\) and \(10^2 = 100\). The sum of these two perfect squares is \(1 + 100 = 101\).",

  "reasoning": "To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( \\binom{10^9}{k} < \\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} \\), we start by expressing these binomial coefficients in terms of factorials:\n\\[
\\binom{10^9}{k} = \\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9 - k)!}
\\]\nand\n\\[
\\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \\frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k - 1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}.
\\]\nWe need to find when the inequality holds:\n\\[
\\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \\frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k - 1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}.
\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[
\\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \\frac{(10^9 + 1)(10^9)!}{(k - 1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}.
\\]\nThis simplifies further to:\n\\[
\\frac{1}{k} < \\frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 + 2 - k}.
\\]\nRearranging gives us:\n\\[
k > \\frac{10^9 + 2}{10^9 + 1}.
\\]\nSince \( \\frac{10^9 + 2}{10^9 + 1} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{10^9 + 1} \\), we approximate \( k \\) as slightly more than 1. Therefore, the smallest integer \( k \\) satisfying this inequality is \( k = 2 \\).\n\nNow, the first digit of \( k \\) is \( a = 2 \\) and the second digit is \( b = 0 \\). Thus, \( 10a + b = 10 \\cdot 2 + 0 = 20 \\).",
