Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 3. Extracted: {or} \quad b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \]

Since \( b \neq 0 \), we solve the quadratic equation:

\[ b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \):

Here, \( A = 1 \), \( B = -6 \), and \( C = -7 \):

\[ b = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 28}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 8}{2} \]

This yields two solutions:

\[ b = \frac{6 + 8}{2} = 7 \]
\[ b = \frac{6 - 8}{2} = -1 \]

Since \( b \) must be a positive integer greater than the largest digit used (which is 6), we have:

\[ b = 7 \]

Thus, the value of the base \( b \) is:

\[

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 8. Extracted: {"answer": 6.3}

To explain the reasoning behind this answer:

Given that the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, we can write the relationship as \(E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}\), or equivalently, \(E = k / \lambda\) for some constant \(k\).

For a photon of red light with a wavelength of \(7 \times 10^{-7}\) meters, let's denote its energy as \(E_1\). Then,
\[ E_1 = \frac{k}{7 \times 10^{-7}}. \]

If another photon has 2000 times the energy of the red photon, its energy \(E_2\) would be:
\[ E_2 = 2000 \times E_1 = 2000 \times \frac{k}{7 \times 10^{-7}}. \]

Since \(E_2 = \frac{k}{\lambda_2}\), we can equate and solve for \(\lambda_2\):
\[ \frac{k}{\lambda_2} = 2000 \times \frac{k}{7 \times 10^{-7}}, \]
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2000}, \]
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 10^3}, \]
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 10^3} = \frac{7}{2} \times 10^{-10} = 3.5 \times 10^{-10}. \]

Thus, the wavelength \(\lambda_2\) is \(3.5 \times 10^{-10}

  "reasoning": "Given that the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 12x + k = 0\) are positive prime numbers, we can denote these roots as \(p\) and \(q\). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots \(p + q\) equals the coefficient of \(x\) with the opposite sign, which is 12 in this case. Therefore, \(p + q = 12\). Also, the product of the roots \(pq\) equals the constant term \(k\). We need to find two prime numbers whose sum is 12. The only pair of prime numbers that satisfy this condition is 5 and 7.

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 11. Extracted: {5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the areas involved:
- The area of the larger circle with radius \(2\) is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).
- The area of the smaller circle with radius \(1\) is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\).

The shaded region consists of segments from both circles. Let \(\theta\) be the central angle in radians subtended by the arcs of both circles.

The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[ \text{Area of larger sector} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta \]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[ \text{Area of smaller sector} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2} \]

The area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord in the larger circle is:
\[ \text{Area of larger triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \]

The area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord in the smaller circle is:
\[ \text{Area of smaller triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) \]

The area of the shaded region in the larger circle is:
\[ \text{Shaded area in larger circle} = 2\theta - 2 \sin(\theta) \]

The area of the shaded region in the smaller circle is:
\[ \text{Shaded area in smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) \]

Thus, the total shaded area is:
\[ \text{Total shaded area} = \left(2\theta - 2 \sin(\theta)\right) + \left(\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)\right) = \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5}{2} \sin(\theta) \]

Given that the total shaded area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[ \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5}{2} \sin(\theta) = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5}{2} \sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]
\[ \theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3} \]

We need to solve this equation for \(\theta\). By inspection or numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).

Converting \(\theta\) to degrees:
\[ \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[ \boxed{120}

   - So, the right triangle has legs of 6 cm and 8 cm, and a hypotenuse of 10 cm.

2. **Calculate the area of the large triangle:**
   - The area \(A\) of a right triangle is given by:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8 = 24 \text{ cm}^2
     \]

3. **Determine the dimensions of the smaller triangle:**
   - The smaller triangle shares the same height as the larger triangle but has a base of 3 cm.
   - The height of the smaller triangle is the same as the height of the larger triangle, which is 8 cm.
   - Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is:
     \[
     A_{\text{small}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 8 = 12 \text{ cm}^2

4. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**

- Row 3 has 3 numbers, so up to row 3 there are \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\) numbers.

- Row 7 has 7 numbers, so up to row 7 there are \(21 + 7 = 28\) numbers.
- Row 8 has 8 numbers, so up to row 8 there are \(28 + 8 = 36\) numbers.

Since the 30th number falls between the cumulative counts of 28 (up to row 7) and 36 (up to row 8), it is in the 8th row. Specifically, it is the \(30 - 28 = 2\)nd number in the 8th row.

Each number in the 8th row is 8, so the 30th number is 8.

Thus, the answer is:

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n\) and the conditions that \(\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}\) is real and \(\left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = 2\), we need to find the product of all possible values of \(z_1\).

First, let's express \(z_3\) and \(z_4\) in terms of \(z_1\) and \(z_2\):
\[ z_3 = z_2^2 z_1 \]
\[ z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^4 z_1^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2 \]

Next, we use the condition \(\left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = 2\):
\[ \left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{z_2^3 z_1}\right| = \frac{1}{|z_2|^3 |z_1|} = 2 \]
Thus,
\[ |z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2} \]

Similarly, we express \(z_5\) in terms of \(z_1\) and \(z_2\):
\[ z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{10} z_1^4 z_2^2 z_1 = z_2^{12} z_1^5 \]

Using the condition \(\left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = 2\):
\[ \left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = \left|\frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^{12} z_1^5}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^3}\right| = \frac{1}{|z_2|^7 |z_1|^3} = 2 \]
Thus,
\[ |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]

We now have two equations:
\[ |z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]

Let \(a = |z_1|\) and \(b = |z_2|\). Then the equations become:
\[ b^3 a = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ b^7 a^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]

From the first equation, we get:
\[ a = \frac{1}{2b^3} \]

Substitute \(a\) into the second equation:
\[ b^7 \left(\frac{1}{2b^3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ b^7 \cdot \frac{1}{8b^9} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{b^7}{8b^9} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{1}{8b^2} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ 8b^2 = 2 \]
\[ b^2 = \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ b = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now substitute \(b = \frac{1}{2}\) back into \(a = \frac{1}{2b^3}\):
\[ a = \frac{1}{2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3} = \frac{1}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{8}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4 \]

Therefore, \(|z_1| = 4\). Since \(z_1\) is not real, it can be written as \(z_1 = 4e^{i\theta}\) where \(\theta \neq 0, \pi\).

The product of all possible values of \(z_1\) is:
\[ 4e^{i\theta} \cdot 4e^{-i\theta} = 16 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{16}

  "reasoning": "To solve the given system of equations, we can use complex numbers. Let's define \( z = a + bi \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit. Then, the given equations can be rewritten in terms of \( z \). The first equation becomes the real part and the second equation becomes the imaginary part of a single complex equation.\n\nThe given equations are:\n\[ a + \frac{17a + 6b}{a^2 + b^2} = 6, \\ b + \frac{6a - 17b}{a^2 + b^2} = 0. \\]\nWe can rewrite these as:\n\[ a + \frac{17a + 6bi}{|z|^2} = 6, \\ b + \frac{6ai - 17b}{|z|^2} = 0. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\[ a + \frac{17a + 6bi}{a^2 + b^2} = 6, \\ b + \frac{6ai - 17b}{a^2 + b^2} = 0. \\]\nCombining these into a single complex equation, we get:\n\[ z + \frac{(17+6i)z}{|z|^2} = 6. \\]\nSince \( |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2 \), we have:\n\[ z + \frac{(17+6i)z}{a^2 + b^2} = 6. \\]\nMultiplying through by \( a^2 + b^2 \) gives:\n\[ (a^2 + b^2)z + (17+6i)z = 6(a^2 + b^2). \\]\nFactoring out \( z \) on the left side, we get:\n\[ z((a^2 + b^2) + (17+6i)) = 6(a^2 + b^2). \\]\nSimplifying further, we obtain:\n\[ z(1 + 17 + 6i) = 6(a^2 + b^2). \\]\nThus,\n\[ z(18 + 6i) = 6(a^2 + b^2). \\]\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n\[ z(3 + i) = a^2 + b^2. \\]\nSince \( z = a + bi \), we have:\n\[ (a + bi)(3 + i) = a^2 + b^2. \\]\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\[ (a + bi)(3 + i) = 3a + ai + 3bi + bi^2 = 3a + ai + 3bi - b = (3a - b) + (a + 3b)i. \\]\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations:\n\[ 3a - b = a^2 + b^2, \\ a + 3b = 0. \\]\nFrom the second equation, we have \( a = -3b \). Substituting \( a = -3b \) into the first equation, we get:\n\[ 3(-3b) - b = (-3b)^2 + b^2, \\ -9b - b = 9b^2 + b^2, \\ -10b = 10b^2, \\ b(b + 1) = 0. \\]\nSo, \( b = 0 \) or \( b = -1 \).\nIf \( b = 0 \), then \( a = 0 \). If \( b = -1 \), then \( a = 3 \).\nTherefore, the solutions are \( (0, 0) \) and \( (3, -1) \). Summing the coordinates, we get \( 0 + 0 + 3 - 1 = 2 \\).",

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 55. Extracted: {pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, compute the square of the matrix on the left-hand side:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We equate this result to the matrix on the right-hand side:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

This gives us four equations by comparing corresponding elements:

1. \(a^2 + bc = c\)
2. \(ab + bd = a\)
3. \(ac + dc = d\)
4. \(bc + d^2 = b\)

Let's analyze these equations one by one.

### Equation 1: \(a^2 + bc = c\)
Rearrange to get:
\[ a^2 + bc - c = 0 \]
\[ a^2 + c(b-1) = 0 \]

### Equation 2: \(ab + bd = a\)
Factor out \(b\):
\[ b(a + d) = a \]

### Equation 3: \(ac + dc = d\)
Factor out \(c\):
\[ c(a + d) = d \]

### Equation 4: \(bc + d^2 = b\)
Rearrange to get:
\[ bc + d^2 - b = 0 \]
\[ b(c-1) + d^2 = 0 \]

Now, consider different cases for \(a + d\):

#### Case 1: \(a + d = 0\)
If \(a + d = 0\), then \(d = -a\). Substitute \(d = -a\) into the equations:

From Equation 2:
\[ b(a - a) = a \implies 0 = a \implies a = 0 \]
Thus, \(d = -a = 0\).

Substitute \(a = 0\) and \(d = 0\) into Equations 1 and 4:
\[ 0^2 + c(b-1) = 0 \implies c(b-1) = 0 \]
\[ b(c-1) + 0^2 = 0 \implies b(c-1) = 0 \]

So, either \(b = 0\) or \(c = 1\).

- If \(b = 0\), then \(c\) can be any real number.
- If \(c = 1\), then \(b\) can be any real number.

Thus, the solutions in this case are:
\[ (a, b, c, d) = (0, b, c, 0) \text{ where } b = 0 \text{ or } c = 1 \]

This gives us two sub-cases:
1. \(b = 0\), \(c\) is any real number.
2. \(c = 1\), \(b\) is any real number.

Each sub-case provides infinitely many solutions.

#### Case 2: \(a + d \neq 0\)
If \(a + d \neq 0\), then from Equations 2 and 3:
\[ b = \frac{a}{a+d} \]
\[ c = \frac{d}{a+d} \]

Substitute \(b = \frac{a}{a+d}\) and \(c = \frac{d}{a+d}\) into Equations 1 and 4:
\[ a^2 + \left(\frac{d}{a+d}\right)(b-1) = 0 \]
\[ \left(\frac{a}{a+d}\right)\left(\frac{d}{a+d}-1\right) + d^2 = 0 \]

Simplify:
\[ a^2 + \frac{d(a+d-b)}{(a+d)^2} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{ad - a - d^2 + d}{(a+d)^2} + d^2 = 0 \]

These simplify to contradictions unless \(a = 0\) and \(d = 0\), which we already considered.

Therefore, the only valid solutions are those from Case 1, giving infinitely many solutions.

Since the problem asks for the number of ordered quadruples, and there are infinitely many solutions, the answer is:

\[

  "reasoning": "Let's denote the smaller perfect square as \(a^2\) and the larger one as \(b^2\). We know that the difference between these two squares is 99, so we have \(b^2 - a^2 = 99\). This can be factored into \((b-a)(b+a) = 99\). Since there are exactly two other perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\), the difference between consecutive perfect squares must be at least 3 (since \(1^2=1\), \(2^2=4\), \(3^2=9\), and \(4^2=16\) shows a minimum gap of 3 between the smallest two non-consecutive perfect squares). Therefore, \(b - a\) must be 3 because if it were any larger, there would be more than two perfect squares in between. So, we have \(b + a = 33\) and \(b - a = 3\). Adding these equations gives \(2b = 36\), so \(b = 18\). Subtracting the second equation from the first gives \(2a = 30\), so \(a = 15\). Thus, the two perfect squares are \(15^2 = 225\) and \(18^2 = 324\). Their sum is \(225 + 324 = 549\).",

For the smallest semicircle with radius 2 cm:

Now, we sum the areas of the semicircles:
\[ \text{Total Area} = 32\pi + 18\pi + 8\pi + 2\pi = 60\pi \]

Since the shaded regions consist of alternating semicircles, we need to subtract the areas of the unshaded semicircles from the total area of all semicircles:
\[ \text{Shaded Area} = 32\pi + 8\pi - (18\pi + 2\pi) = 40\pi - 20\pi = 20\pi \]

Now, set the midpoint of BD equal to the midpoint of AC:
\[ \left(\frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2}\right) = \left(6, \frac{7}{2}\right) \]

This gives us two equations:

Solve the first equation for x:
\[ 6 + x = 12 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x > 7 \), this value does not satisfy the condition. Let's re-evaluate the setup. We should consider the vector approach:

Vector AB = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)
Vector DC should be equal to Vector AB since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.

Given point C(7, 4), we add vector AB to point C to find point D:
\[ D = (7 + 1, 4 + 5) = (8, 9) \]

Thus, the coordinates of D are (8, 9).

Finally, calculate \( x + y \):

\frac{\frac{1 - \cos x}{\cos x}}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}} = \frac{1 - \cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{1 + \cos x} - \frac{1 - \cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Next, find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{\sin^2 x - (1 - \cos x)(1 + \cos x)}{(1 + \cos x) \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the numerator:
\[
\sin^2 x - (1 - \cos^2 x).
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1 \implies 1 - \cos^2 x = \sin^2 x.
\]

So,
\[
\sin^2 x - (1 - \cos^2 x) = \sin^2 x - \sin^2 x = 0.
\]

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{0}{(1 + \cos x) \sin x} = 0.
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the given expression is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 87. Extracted: {10^9}{k}\) is less than \(\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\).

First, recall the definition of the binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

We need to compare:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}
\]

Using the definition of the binomial coefficient, we have:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} = \frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!}
\]
\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Rewriting these expressions, we get:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} = \frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!}
\]
\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \frac{(10^9 + 1) \cdot 10^9!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Simplifying the inequality:
\[
\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1) \cdot 10^9!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Cancel out \(10^9!\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{k!(10^9-k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Rewrite the factorials:
\[
\frac{1}{k \cdot (k-1)!(10^9-k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)!}
\]

Cancel out \((k-1)!\):
\[
\frac{1}{k \cdot (10^9-k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)!}
\]

Since \((10^9 + 1 - k)! = (10^9 + 1 - k)(10^9 - k)!\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{k \cdot (10^9-k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)(10^9 - k)!}
\]

Cancel out \((10^9 - k)!\):
\[
\frac{1}{k} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)}
\]

Multiply both sides by \(k(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)\):
\[
(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k) < k(10^9 + 1)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k) = 10^{18} + 3 \cdot 10^9 + 2 - 2 \cdot 10^9 - 3k + k^2
\]
\[
= 10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < k(10^9 + 1)
\]

Rearrange terms:
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < 10^9k + k
\]
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < 10^9k + k
\]
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 < 10^9k + 4k - k^2
\]

Approximating for large \(10^9\):
\[
10^{18} \approx 10^9k
\]
\[
k \approx 10^9 / 10^9 = 1
\]

Testing values around \(k = 500000000\):
\[
k = 500000000
\]

Thus, the first two digits of \(k\) are 5 and 0. Therefore, \(10a + b = 10 \times 5 + 0 = 50\).

\[

Check if \(b = 9\) and \(c = 8\) satisfy both original conditions:
1. \(b^2 = 9^2 = 81\)
   \[c^2 + 2c + 1 = 8^2 + 2 \cdot 8 + 1 = 64 + 16 + 1 = 81\]
   This is true.
   
2. \(c^2 = 8^2 = 64\)
   \[7b + 1 = 7 \cdot 9 + 1 = 63 + 1 = 64\]
   This is also true.

Thus, \(b = 9\) and \(c = 8\) are valid solutions.

Finally, calculate \(b + c\):
