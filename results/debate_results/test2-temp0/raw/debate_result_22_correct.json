    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about watermelons losing water content as they cross the desert. The initial weight is 100 kg, and the water content goes from 99% to 98%. I need to find the new weight.\n\nHmm, so watermelons are mostly water. Initially, 99% of their weight is water. That means the non-water part is 1%. So, the dry mass is 1% of 100 kg, which is 1 kg. Right? Because 100 kg times 0.01 is 1 kg.\n\nNow, after crossing the desert, the water content is 98%. That means the dry mass is now 2% of the total weight. Wait, because if water is 98%, then the non-water part is 2%. But the dry mass hasn't changed, right? It's still 1 kg. So, if 2% of the new total weight is 1 kg, then the total weight must be 1 kg divided by 0.02, which is 50 kg. So the answer is 50 kg?\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. If the water content drops by 1%, the weight halves? But maybe that's because the dry mass is a small percentage. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal total weight: 100 kg. Water: 99 kg, dry: 1 kg. After drying, water is 98%, so dry is 2%. Let x be the new total weight. Then 2% of x is 1 kg. So 0.02x = 1 => x = 1 / 0.02 = 50 kg. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer is 50 kg. But why does it drop so much? Because the dry mass is a small part, so even a small change in the percentage of water leads to a big change in total weight. That makes sense. So the answer is 50 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe current weight of the watermelons is **50 kilograms**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Composition**:  \n   - Total weight = 100 kg  \n   - Water content = 99% → 99 kg of water  \n   - Dry mass = 1% → 1 kg (non-water content, e.g., pulp, seeds).  \n\n2. **After Drying**:  \n   - Water content decreases to 98%, so the dry mass now constitutes **2%** of the total weight.  \n   - Since the dry mass remains unchanged (1 kg), we set up the equation:  \n     $$\n     2\\% \\text{ of new total weight} = 1 \\, \\text{kg} \\implies 0.02x = 1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{0.02} = 50 \\, \\text{kg}.\n     $$\n\n**Key Insight**: The dry mass (1 kg) becomes a larger proportion of the total weight (2%) after drying, which drastically reduces the total weight despite only a 1% drop in water content. This counterintuitive result arises because the dry mass is a small fraction of the original weight, so even a small change in its proportion leads to a significant shift in total mass.",
