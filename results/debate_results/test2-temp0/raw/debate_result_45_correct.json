    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says a man is given a task, and he doubles the amount of work he does every day. He finishes the entire task in 20 days. The question is, how many days did it take him to complete 25% of the task?\n\nHmm, so first, I need to understand how the doubling works. If he doubles the task done each day, does that mean that each day he does twice as much as the previous day? So like, on day 1, he does some amount, day 2 he does twice that, day 3 four times, and so on? That seems like exponential growth. So the total work done after n days would be the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but the problem says he completes the task in 20 days. So the total work is the sum of his daily work from day 1 to day 20. Let me think. If each day he does double the previous day's work, then the work done on day k is 2^(k-1) times the work done on day 1. Let me denote the work done on day 1 as x. Then day 2 is 2x, day 3 is 4x, ..., day 20 is 2^19 x. The total work would be x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^19 x. That's a geometric series with ratio 2, starting from x, for 20 terms. The sum of a geometric series is S = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the ratio, n is the number of terms. So here, S = x*(2^20 - 1)/(2 - 1) = x*(2^20 - 1). And this total sum is equal to the entire task, let's say the total task is T. So T = x*(2^20 - 1).\n\nNow, the question is, on which day did he complete 25% of the task? So 25% of T is T/4. We need to find the day when the cumulative work done reaches T/4.\n\nBut wait, the cumulative work done each day is the sum up to that day. Let me think. Let's denote the cumulative work after day n as S_n. So S_n = x*(2^n - 1). Because the sum of the geometric series up to n terms is x*(2^n - 1). Since the total task is T = x*(2^20 - 1), we can set S_n = T/4.\n\nSo:\n\nx*(2^n - 1) = (x*(2^20 - 1))/4\n\nDivide both sides by x:\n\n(2^n - 1) = (2^20 - 1)/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4*(2^n - 1) = 2^20 - 1\n\nLet me compute 4*(2^n - 1) = 2^20 - 1\n\nSo 4*2^n - 4 = 2^20 - 1\n\nThen 4*2^n = 2^20 - 1 + 4 = 2^20 + 3\n\nHmm, that seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the total task T is x*(2^20 - 1). The cumulative work on day n is x*(2^n - 1). So setting x*(2^n - 1) = T/4 = [x*(2^20 - 1)] / 4. Then cancelling x:\n\n(2^n - 1) = (2^20 - 1)/4\n\nSo 2^n - 1 = (2^20 - 1)/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4*(2^n - 1) = 2^20 - 1\n\nWhich is 4*2^n - 4 = 2^20 - 1\n\nThen 4*2^n = 2^20 - 1 + 4 = 2^20 + 3\n\nHmm, but 4*2^n is 2^2 * 2^n = 2^(n+2). So:\n\n2^(n+2) = 2^20 + 3\n\nBut 2^20 is a huge number, and 2^20 + 3 is not a power of 2. That suggests that maybe my approach is wrong. Because the left side is a power of 2, and the right side is not. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means that my initial assumption about the model might be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not that he doubles the amount of work each day, but that he doubles the amount of work he has done so far each day? Wait, the wording is: \"He doubles the task done everyday.\" Hmm, that's ambiguous. Does it mean that each day he does double the amount of work compared to the previous day, or that each day he doubles the total work done so far?\n\nIf it's the former, then the total work is the sum of a geometric series as I did before. But that leads to an equation that doesn't have an integer solution for n, which is problematic because days are integers.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is that each day he doubles the total work done so far, then the total work done on day n would be double the total work done on day n-1. That would mean that the total work done on day n is 2 times the total work done on day n-1. But that would mean that the total work done on day 1 is x, day 2 is 2x, day 3 is 4x, etc., which is the same as before. Wait, that's the same as the first interpretation. So that leads to the same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he doubles the amount of work he does each day, but the total work is completed on day 20. So the total work is the sum of the work done each day, which is a geometric series. But then, when trying to find when he completed 25% of the task, the equation doesn't resolve to an integer day. That seems odd. Maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, another way: maybe the task is completed on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he did the last part of the task. If the work doubles each day, then the work done on day 20 is twice the work done on day 19. So the total work is the sum of all days up to day 20. But if the total work is T, then T = sum_{k=1}^{20} 2^{k-1} * x. Which is x*(2^20 - 1). So T = x*(2^20 - 1). Then 25% of T is T/4 = x*(2^20 - 1)/4. Now, the cumulative work after day n is x*(2^n - 1). So we need to find n such that x*(2^n - 1) = x*(2^20 - 1)/4. Which simplifies to 2^n - 1 = (2^20 - 1)/4. Then 2^n = (2^20 - 1)/4 + 1 = (2^20 - 1 + 4)/4 = (2^20 + 3)/4. Which is not a power of 2. Therefore, there is no integer n that satisfies this equation. That suggests that maybe the problem is not about cumulative work, but about the work done on a particular day?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not about cumulative work, but about the work done on a particular day. For example, if the task is completed on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he did the remaining part of the task. If the work doubles each day, then the work done on day 20 is twice the work done on day 19. So the total work is the sum of all days up to day 20. But if the total work is T, then T = sum_{k=1}^{20} 2^{k-1} * x. Which is x*(2^20 - 1). So T = x*(2^20 - 1). Now, if we want to find when he completed 25% of the task, maybe it's referring to the work done on a specific day, not the cumulative. But that seems unlikely because 25% of the task would be a cumulative amount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the man completes the task on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he did the last part of the task, and the total work is the sum of all days. But if the work doubles each day, then the work done on day 20 is 2^19 * x, and the total work is 2^20 * x - x. Wait, that's the same as before. So T = x*(2^20 - 1). Then 25% of T is T/4 = x*(2^20 - 1)/4. Now, the cumulative work after day n is x*(2^n - 1). So we need to find n where x*(2^n - 1) = x*(2^20 - 1)/4. Which again leads to 2^n - 1 = (2^20 - 1)/4. Which is not a power of 2. Therefore, there's no integer solution. That seems like a problem.\n\nBut the question is from a math problem, so there must be an answer. Maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Perhaps the man doubles the amount of work he does each day, but the total work is completed on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he did the entire task. Wait, that would be different. If on day 20, he did the entire task, then the work done on day 20 is T. But if he doubles the work each day, then the work done on day 1 is x, day 2 is 2x, day 3 is 4x, ..., day 20 is 2^19 x. So 2^19 x = T. Then T = 2^19 x. Then 25% of T is 2^19 x / 4 = 2^17 x. Now, the work done on day n is 2^{n-1} x. So to find when he did 2^17 x, set 2^{n-1} x = 2^17 x => n-1 = 17 => n=18. So day 18. But this interpretation is different from the previous one. The problem says \"completely does the task in 20 days\", which could mean that on day 20, he completed the task, implying that the total work is done on day 20, not the sum of all days. That would be a different model.\n\nSo which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"He doubles the task done everyday. If the man completely does the task in 20 days...\" So \"doubles the task done everyday\" could mean that each day, the amount of work he does is double the previous day's work. So the work done on day 1 is x, day 2 is 2x, day 3 is 4x, etc. Then the total work done after n days is x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^{n-1}x = x*(2^n - 1). If he completes the task in 20 days, then the total work is x*(2^20 - 1). But if the problem says he completes the task on day 20, that might mean that on day 20, he did the remaining work to finish the task, which would be different. For example, if the total work is T, and on day 20, he did the last part, which is T - sum_{k=1}^{19} 2^{k-1}x. But that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the classic \"a lily pad doubles in size every day, covers the pond on day 20, when was it half covered?\" In that case, the answer is day 19, because it doubles each day. So applying that logic here, if the task is completed on day 20, then 25% of the task would be completed on day 18, because each day it's doubling. Wait, but 25% is 1/4, and if the task is completed on day 20, then on day 19, it was half done, day 18 was 1/4, day 17 was 1/8, etc. That seems to make sense. But this is under the assumption that the total work is done on day 20, and each day the work done is doubling, so the total work is the work done on day 20. But that would mean that the total work is 2^19 x, as before. Then 25% of that is 2^17 x, which would be done on day 18. But this is different from the previous model where the total work is the sum of all days.\n\nSo which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"He doubles the task done everyday. If the man completely does the task in 20 days...\" The phrase \"completely does the task in 20 days\" could mean that on day 20, he finishes the task, implying that the total work is the sum of all days up to day 20. But in that case, the previous equations don't give an integer solution. However, if we take the alternative interpretation where the total work is done on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task, then the answer is day 18. But this is a different model.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check similar problems. In the lily pad problem, the pond is fully covered on day 20, so half covered on day 19, because it doubles each day. That's because the growth is exponential, and the total coverage on day 20 is double that of day 19. So if the total task is completed on day 20, then the amount of work done on day 20 is double the work done on day 19, which would mean that the work done on day 19 is half of the total task. Therefore, 25% would be on day 18. So this seems to be the intended interpretation.\n\nBut in that case, the total work is not the sum of all days, but the work done on day 20 is the total task. That would mean that the work done on day 1 is x, day 2 is 2x, day 3 is 4x, ..., day 20 is 2^19 x = T. Therefore, T = 2^19 x. Then 25% of T is 2^17 x, which is the work done on day 18 (since day 18 is 2^17 x). Therefore, the answer would be day 18.\n\nBut this contradicts the first interpretation where the total work is the sum of all days. However, the lily pad analogy suggests that the total work is the work done on the final day, not the sum. So maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. If the man doubles the task done every day, and finishes in 20 days, then on day 20, he did the last part. Since each day's work is double the previous, the work done on day 20 is twice that of day 19. Therefore, the work done on day 19 is half of the total task, and day 18 is a quarter, etc. So 25% would be on day 18.\n\nBut this assumes that the total work is the work done on day 20, not the sum of all days. That seems to be the case in the lily pad problem. So maybe that's the intended approach here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be day 18. But I need to confirm.\n\nLet me think again. If the total work is T, and on day 20, he does the last part, which is 2^19 x, and T = 2^19 x. Then 25% of T is 2^17 x, which is the work done on day 18. Therefore, the answer is 18 days.\n\nBut if the total work is the sum of all days, then the equation doesn't resolve to an integer. Therefore, the problem must be intended to be interpreted as the work done on day 20 is the total task, not the sum. Hence, the answer is 18 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the way the task is being doubled. If the man doubles the task done every day, meaning that each day he completes double the amount of the task compared to the previous day. So on day 1, he does 1/2^19 of the task, day 2 does 2/2^19, day 3 does 4/2^19, ..., day 20 does 2^19/2^19 = 1. So the total task is the sum from day 1 to day 20 of 2^{k-1}/2^19, which is (2^20 - 1)/2^19. But that's not 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if on day 20, he does the entire task, then the work done on day 20 is T, and each day's work is double the previous. So day 1: T/2^19, day 2: T/2^18, ..., day 20: T. Then the total work done over 20 days would be T*(1/2^19 + 1/2^18 + ... + 1/2^0). Which is T*( (1 - (1/2)^20 ) / (1 - 1/2) ) = T*(2 - 1/2^19). Which is more than T. That can't be right. So this approach is flawed.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me try to look for another angle. If the man doubles the task done every day, and finishes in 20 days, then the work done on day 20 is double that of day 19. Let's denote the work done on day 1 as W. Then day 2: 2W, day 3: 4W, ..., day n: 2^{n-1}W. The total work done after n days is W*(2^n - 1). If he finishes the task on day 20, then the total work is W*(2^20 - 1). Now, 25% of the task is 0.25 * W*(2^20 - 1). We need to find the day when the cumulative work reaches this amount.\n\nSo, cumulative work after day k is W*(2^k - 1). Set this equal to 0.25 * W*(2^20 - 1):\n\n2^k - 1 = 0.25*(2^20 - 1)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4*(2^k - 1) = 2^20 - 1\n\nWhich is 2^{k+2} - 4 = 2^20 - 1\n\nThen 2^{k+2} = 2^20 - 1 + 4 = 2^20 + 3\n\nBut 2^20 + 3 is not a power of 2, so there's no integer k that satisfies this. Therefore, this suggests that under this model, there is no day where the cumulative work is exactly 25% of the total task. But the problem must have an answer, so this indicates that the initial model is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the other interpretation must be correct: that the total work is done on day 20, meaning that the work done on day 20 is the entire task. In this case, the work done on day 20 is 2^{19}W = T. Then, the work done on day k is 2^{k-1}W. To find when the work done is 25% of T, which is 0.25*T = 0.25*2^{19}W = 2^{17}W. Setting 2^{k-1}W = 2^{17}W gives k-1 = 17 => k=18. So day 18.\n\nThis seems to be the only way to get an integer answer, and it aligns with the lily pad problem logic. Therefore, the answer is 18 days.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a man completing a task by doubling the amount of work he does each day, finishing the task on day 20. To determine when he completed 25% of the task, we analyze the exponential growth of his daily work.\n\n### Key Assumptions:\n- **Daily Work Doubling**: Each day, the man does **twice** the work of the previous day. This implies the work done on day $ n $ is $ 2^{n-1} \\times x $, where $ x $ is the work done on day 1.\n- **Task Completion on Day 20**: The total task is completed on day 20, meaning the **work done on day 20** is the entire task $ T $. Thus, $ T = 2^{19}x $ (since day 20's work is $ 2^{19}x $).\n\n### Solving for 25% of the Task:\n- 25% of the task is $ \\frac{T}{4} = \\frac{2^{19}x}{4} = 2^{17}x $.\n- The work done on day $ k $ is $ 2^{k-1}x $. Setting this equal to $ 2^{17}x $:\n  $$\n  2^{k-1}x = 2^{17}x \\implies k - 1 = 17 \\implies k = 18.\n  $$\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe man completed **25% of the task on day 18**. This aligns with the logic of exponential growth, where each day's work doubles, and the task is completed on day 20. Thus, the cumulative work on day 18 corresponds to 25% of the total task.\n\n**Answer:** 18 days.",
