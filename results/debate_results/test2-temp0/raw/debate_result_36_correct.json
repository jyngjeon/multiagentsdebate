    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about two circles, A and B, that are externally tangent. Circle A has a radius that's 1/3 of Circle B's radius. Circle A rolls around Circle B without slipping, and we need to find out how many times Circle A revolves as it goes around once.\n\nHmm, I remember something about rolling without slipping. When a circle rolls around another, the number of revolutions it makes depends on the ratio of their circumferences. But wait, there's also the path it takes. If it's going around a circle, the center of Circle A would be moving along a circular path with a radius equal to the sum of the two radii, right? Because they're externally tangent. So the distance the center travels is the circumference of that larger circle.\n\nLet me write down the radii. Let's say radius of B is R, so radius of A is R/3. The circumference of B is 2πR, and the circumference of A is 2π(R/3) = (2πR)/3. \n\nNow, if Circle A rolls around Circle B without slipping, the distance that Circle A's center travels is the circumference of the path it takes. Since they're externally tangent, the center of A is at a distance of R + (R/3) = (4R)/3 from the center of B. So the circumference of the path is 2π*(4R/3) = (8πR)/3.\n\nIf there were no rotation due to going around the circle, just rolling along a straight line, the number of revolutions would be the distance divided by the circumference of A. So that would be [(8πR)/3] / [(2πR)/3] = 4. So 4 revolutions? But wait, I think there's an extra rotation because when you go around a circle, the direction of rotation changes. Like, if you roll a coin around another coin of the same size, it makes two revolutions. Wait, but that's when they're the same size. Let me recall.\n\nActually, the formula I remember is that when a circle rolls around another circle of radius R, the number of revolutions is (R + r)/r, where r is the radius of the rolling circle. But in this case, since it's externally tangent, maybe it's (R + r)/r? Wait, but if the radius of A is r = R/3, then (R + r)/r = (R + R/3)/(R/3) = (4R/3)/(R/3) = 4. So that gives 4 revolutions. But I thought when you have a coin going around another of the same size, it's 2 revolutions. Wait, maybe that formula is different. Let me check.\n\nWait, if the radius of the fixed circle is R, and the rolling circle has radius r, then the number of rotations is (R/r) + 1 if it's going around externally. Wait, but if R = r, then that would be 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the coin example. So in that case, the formula is (R/r) + 1. But in our case, R is the radius of B, and r is the radius of A, which is R/3. So substituting, (R/(R/3)) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. So that gives 4 revolutions. But then why does the formula (R + r)/r give the same answer? Because (R + r)/r = R/r + 1. So that's the same thing. So that seems to check out.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure. Let me think again. If the center moves along a circle of radius R + r, the distance is 2π(R + r). The number of rotations would be that distance divided by the circumference of the rolling circle, which is 2πr. So (2π(R + r))/(2πr) = (R + r)/r = R/r + 1. So that's the formula. So in this case, R is the radius of B, which is 3 times the radius of A. So R/r = 3, so total rotations would be 3 + 1 = 4. So the answer is 4?\n\nBut wait, I've heard conflicting things before. For example, when a coin rolls around another of the same size, it makes two rotations. But according to this formula, if R = r, then (R + r)/r = 2, which is correct. So that seems to work. So in our case, since R is three times r, it's 4. So the answer is 4?\n\nBut I also remember that when you have a circle rolling on the outside of another, the number of rotations is (R + r)/r, and if it's rolling on the inside, it's (R - r)/r. So in this case, since it's externally tangent, it's on the outside, so (R + r)/r. So that's 4. So that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut let me think of another way. Suppose the circle A rolls around B. If you imagine the point of contact, as it goes around, the rotation is due to both the movement around the circle and the rotation of the circle itself. So if you fix the center of B, and move A around it, the rotation of A is a combination of the orbital motion and the spin.\n\nAlternatively, think about the total angle that the center of A moves around B. It goes around 360 degrees. The rotation of A is such that the point of contact doesn't slip. So the arc length that A rolls over B must equal the arc length that A rotates. Wait, but since it's rolling around, the total distance that A's center moves is 2π(R + r). So the number of rotations would be that distance divided by the circumference of A, which is 2πr. So again, (R + r)/r. Which is 4 in this case.\n\nBut maybe there's a different approach. Let's take specific numbers. Let’s say radius of B is 3 units, so radius of A is 1 unit. The circumference of B is 6π, circumference of A is 2π. The center of A moves along a circle of radius 3 + 1 = 4 units, so circumference is 8π. So the distance is 8π. Divided by circumference of A, 2π, gives 4. So 4 rotations. But when you actually do this with coins, if you have a coin of radius 1 going around a coin of radius 3, does it make 4 rotations? Let me try to visualize.\n\nImagine starting with the two coins touching at a point. As the small coin rolls around the big one, for each full rotation around the big coin, how many times does the small one spin? If the big coin is fixed, and the small one rolls around it, the small one would have to rotate around its own center. If you just roll it along a straight line equal to the circumference of the big coin, which is 6π, then the small coin would rotate 6π / 2π = 3 times. But since it's going around the big coin, which is a circle, the center of the small coin is moving along a circle of circumference 8π, so 8π / 2π = 4. So that's 4 rotations. But why is there an extra rotation compared to just rolling along a straight line?\n\nAh, because when you go around the circle, the direction of the rotation is also changing. So the rotation of the small coin is both due to the movement along the path and the rotation around the big coin. So in effect, the total rotation is the rotation from the path plus the rotation from going around the circle. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, think of the rotation as the angle that the small coin turns. If the center moves through an angle θ around the big coin, then the small coin must rotate by θ in the opposite direction to maintain no slipping. But also, the rotation due to the movement along the path. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the total rotation angle.\n\nLet me think of the total rotation of the small coin. When it goes around the big coin once, the center of the small coin makes a full circle around the big coin, which is 2π radians. The rotation of the small coin is such that the point of contact is instantaneously at rest relative to the big coin. So the rotation of the small coin is related to the movement of the center.\n\nThe relationship between the rotation of the small coin and the movement of its center is given by the rolling without slipping condition. The distance rolled over the big coin is equal to the arc length that the small coin rotates. Wait, but since it's rolling around the outside, the arc length on the big coin is equal to the arc length on the small coin. Wait, but the big coin is fixed. So as the small coin rolls around the big one, the arc length that the small coin rolls over the big coin is equal to the arc length that the small coin rotates. But the arc length on the big coin is R * θ, where θ is the angle swept by the center of the small coin around the big coin. Wait, but θ is 2π for a full trip. So the arc length on the big coin is R * 2π. The arc length on the small coin is r * φ, where φ is the total rotation angle of the small coin. So R * 2π = r * φ. Therefore, φ = (R / r) * 2π. So the number of rotations is φ / (2π) = R / r. But in this case, R / r is 3, so 3 rotations. But this contradicts the previous answer of 4. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Earlier, using the center's path, we had 4 rotations, but this method gives 3. Which is right?\n\nLet me check with the case where R = r. If R = r, then according to this method, φ = R / r * 2π = 2π, so number of rotations is 1. But we know that when a coin rolls around another of the same size, it makes 2 rotations. So this method is wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake here.\n\nWhere is the error? The assumption that the arc length on the big coin is equal to the arc length on the small coin. But when rolling around the outside, the small coin is both rotating around the big coin and rotating around its own center. So the total rotation of the small coin is the sum of the rotation due to going around the big coin and the rotation due to rolling. Wait, maybe the arc length on the big coin is equal to the arc length on the small coin, but the rotation of the small coin is also affected by the orbital motion.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total rotation of the small coin as the rotation caused by the movement around the big coin plus the rotation caused by the rolling. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the total rotation angle of the small coin. If the center of the small coin moves along a circular path of radius R + r, then the total angle swept by the center is 2π. The rotation of the small coin is such that the point of contact is instantaneously at rest. So the rotation of the small coin is related to the movement of the center. The velocity of the center of the small coin is v = ω * (R + r), where ω is the angular velocity of the center around the big coin. The angular velocity of the small coin's rotation is Ω, so the velocity at the point of contact is v_contact = Ω * r. But since there's no slipping, the velocity of the point of contact relative to the big coin is zero. Therefore, the velocity of the center of the small coin is equal to the velocity of the point of contact relative to the center. Wait, no. The velocity of the point of contact relative to the big coin is zero. The velocity of the center of the small coin is v = ω * (R + r). The velocity of the point of contact relative to the center of the small coin is -Ω * r (since it's rotating in the opposite direction). Therefore, the total velocity of the point of contact relative to the big coin is v - Ω * r = 0. Therefore, ω * (R + r) - Ω * r = 0 => Ω = ω * (R + r)/r.\n\nSo the angular velocity of the small coin is (R + r)/r times the angular velocity of the center's orbit. Therefore, over the time it takes to go around once, the total rotation angle of the small coin is Ω * t = [(R + r)/r] * ω * t. But ω * t is the angle swept by the center, which is 2π. Therefore, total rotation angle is [(R + r)/r] * 2π. Therefore, the number of rotations is [(R + r)/r] * 2π / (2π) = (R + r)/r. Which is the same as before. So that gives (R + r)/r = 4 in our case. So that's 4 rotations. But earlier, when I thought of the arc length, I had a different answer. Where was the mistake there?\n\nAh, in that approach, I considered the arc length on the big coin as R * θ, but that's only if the small coin is rolling on the big coin's surface. However, when rolling around the outside, the small coin is not just rolling on the big coin's surface but also moving around it. Therefore, the total rotation is not just due to the arc length on the big coin but also the orbital motion. Therefore, the correct formula is (R + r)/r, which gives 4. So that must be the right answer.\n\nBut then why does the arc length approach give a different answer? Let me think again. If the small coin rolls around the big one, the distance that the small coin's center travels is 2π(R + r). If there were no rotation, the small coin would just move around, but since it's rolling, the rotation is such that the distance rolled is equal to the distance traveled. Wait, but the distance rolled would be the arc length that the small coin rotates. So if the center moves a distance of 2π(R + r), then the number of rotations is that distance divided by the circumference of the small coin, which is 2πr. So (2π(R + r))/(2πr) = (R + r)/r. Which is the same as before. So that gives 4. So that's consistent.\n\nEarlier, when I thought of the arc length on the big coin, I was considering the arc length that the small coin rolls over the big coin, which would be R * θ, but that's only if the small coin is rolling on the big coin's surface. However, in reality, the small coin is rolling on the outside, so the total rotation is not just from that arc length but also from the orbital motion. Wait, but how does that reconcile?\n\nWait, if the small coin rolls around the big one, the total rotation is both from the movement around the big coin and the rotation due to the rolling. But according to the previous calculation, the total rotation is (R + r)/r. Which is the same as the distance traveled by the center divided by the circumference. So that seems to be the correct way.\n\nSo in the case where R = r, that gives 2, which is correct. So in our problem, with R = 3r, it's 4. Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut I want to make sure. Let me think of a simple case. If the radius of A is 1/3 of B, so B is 3 units, A is 1 unit. If A rolls around B, how many times does it rotate?\n\nImagine starting with the two circles touching at a point. As A rolls around B, after going 1/4 of the way around B, the center of A has moved 1/4 of the circumference of the path, which is 2π*(4)/4 = 2π. The distance rolled is 2π, so the number of rotations would be 2π / (2π*1) = 1. So after 1/4 of the trip, A has rotated once. Then after 1/2 the trip, it would have rotated twice, and so on. After a full trip, it would have rotated 4 times. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a coin of radius 1 rolling around a coin of radius 3, after going around once, it has rotated 4 times. That seems plausible. But I can also think of the case where the coin rolls around the inside. If it's rolling on the inside, the formula would be (R - r)/r. So if R = 3r, then (3r - r)/r = 2. So it would rotate twice. But that's different from the outside case.\n\nSo in conclusion, the answer should be 4. Therefore, the total number of revolutions is 4.\n</think>\n\nWhen Circle A rolls around Circle B without slipping, the total number of revolutions it makes is determined by both the **distance traveled by its center** and the **ratio of their radii**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Radii and Path**:  \n   - Let the radius of Circle B be $ R $, so the radius of Circle A is $ r = \\frac{R}{3} $.  \n   - The center of Circle A moves along a circular path with radius $ R + r = \\frac{4R}{3} $.  \n   - The **distance traveled by the center** of Circle A is the circumference of this path:  \n     $$\n     \\text{Distance} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{4R}{3}\\right) = \\frac{8\\pi R}{3}.\n     $$\n\n2. **Revolutions from Rolling**:  \n   - The number of revolutions Circle A makes is the distance traveled divided by its own circumference:  \n     $$\n     \\text{Revolutions} = \\frac{\\frac{8\\pi R}{3}}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{\\frac{8\\pi R}{3}}{2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{R}{3}} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4.\n     $$\n\n3. **Key Insight**:  \n   - When a circle rolls around another **externally**, the total number of revolutions is given by:  \n     $$\n     \\frac{R + r}{r} = \\frac{R}{r} + 1.\n     $$  \n     Substituting $ \\frac{R}{r} = 3 $, we get $ 3 + 1 = 4 $.\n\n4. **Verification with Examples**:  \n   - If $ R = r $, the formula gives $ \\frac{R + r}{r} = 2 $, which matches the known result for a coin rolling around another of the same size.  \n   - For $ R = 3r $, the formula correctly yields $ 4 $.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nCircle A will revolve **4 times** in total.  \n\n$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$",
