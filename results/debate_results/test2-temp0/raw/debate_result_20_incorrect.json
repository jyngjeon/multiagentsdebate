    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the pen can write 500 words on average before running out of ink. But there's a catch: when it's warmer, it writes twice as fast. And that warming happened during the first 150 words. Now, after writing 300 words, I need to know how many more words I can write.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the warming affects the ink usage. If the pen writes twice as fast when warm, does that mean it uses ink twice as quickly? Or does it mean that the same amount of ink is used for more words because it's writing faster? Wait, maybe I need to think about the rate of ink consumption.\n\nLet me break it down. The pen's total capacity is 500 words. But the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, so it was writing twice as fast. Then, after that, maybe it's at normal speed? Or does the warming only happen during the first 150 words, and then it's back to normal?\n\nWait, the problem says the pen writes twice as fast when warmer, which happened during the first 150 words. So, the first 150 words were written at double speed. Then, after that, the pen is not warmer anymore, so it's back to normal speed. But the user has already written 300 words. So, the first 150 words were at double speed, and the next 150 words (from 150 to 300) were at normal speed. Then, how much ink is left?\n\nBut wait, the total capacity is 500 words. But if the first 150 words used less ink because it was writing faster? Or more ink? Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf the pen writes twice as fast when warm, that might mean that the same amount of ink is used for more words. Wait, no. If you write faster, you might be using ink more quickly. Wait, but the rate of ink usage depends on the speed. If you write twice as fast, you might be using ink at twice the rate. So, for the same amount of time, you'd use twice as much ink. But the problem is about words written, not time. So maybe the key is to figure out how much ink was used in the first 150 words versus the next 150 words.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pen's ink usage is based on the number of words written, not the time. But the speed affects how many words you can write in a given time. However, the total ink capacity is fixed at 500 words. So, if the pen is writing twice as fast, does that mean that each word uses less ink? Or that the same amount of ink is used per word, but you can write more words in the same time?\n\nThis is tricky. Let me try to model it. Let's assume that the pen's ink usage is based on the number of words written, regardless of speed. But the friend said that the pen writes twice as fast when warm. So, maybe the speed affects how much ink is used per word. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If you write faster, you might be using more ink per word, or the same amount. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pen's ink usage is related to the time it's in use. If you write twice as fast, you can write more words in the same time, but the ink is consumed at a rate that depends on the speed. So, if the pen is writing twice as fast, it uses ink at twice the rate. Therefore, for the same number of words, the time taken is halved, but the ink used is the same. Wait, that might not be right.\n\nLet me think of it in terms of ink consumption per word. Suppose normally, each word uses a certain amount of ink. If the pen is warmer, it writes twice as fast, but does that mean that each word uses less ink? Or that the same amount of ink is used per word, but you can write more words in the same time? I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the total ink capacity is 500 words. But the first 150 words were written at double speed, so they used less ink? Or more? If the pen is writing twice as fast, maybe it's using ink more efficiently. For example, if you write faster, you might be using less ink per word. But that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, maybe the speed doesn't affect ink usage, but the user is just writing faster, so the same amount of ink is used for the same number of words, but the time taken is less.\n\nBut the problem is about how much ink is left after writing 300 words, considering that the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer (twice as fast). So, the total ink capacity is 500 words. If the first 150 words were written at double speed, does that mean that those 150 words used half the ink compared to normal? Because if you write twice as fast, maybe you're using ink more efficiently. But that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed doesn't affect ink usage. The total ink is 500 words, regardless of speed. So, writing 150 words at double speed would use the same amount of ink as writing 150 words at normal speed. But that seems counterintuitive. If you write faster, you might be using more ink per unit time, but the same amount of ink for the same number of words.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the pen's ink usage is based on the number of words, not the time. So, regardless of how fast you write, each word uses the same amount of ink. Therefore, the total ink used for 150 words is the same whether you write them quickly or slowly. Then, the fact that the pen was warmer during the first 150 words might be a red herring, and the total ink used is 300 words, so 200 words left. But that can't be right because the friend mentioned the pen writes twice as fast when warm, which must affect the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pen's ink usage is related to the time it's in use. If the pen is warmer, it writes twice as fast, so for the same number of words, it takes half the time. But the ink is consumed at a rate that depends on the time. So, if you write 150 words at double speed, it takes half the time compared to normal speed. But the ink used would be the same as if you wrote 150 words at normal speed, because the number of words is the same. Therefore, the total ink used for the first 150 words is the same as for the next 150 words. Then, after 300 words, 200 words remain. But that seems to ignore the friend's comment about the pen's speed.\n\nWait, but the problem says the pen writes twice as fast when warmer, which happened during the first 150 words. So, maybe the ink is consumed at a different rate during that time. Let me think in terms of ink consumption rate.\n\nLet’s assume that the pen has a certain ink capacity, say, 500 words. The rate at which ink is consumed depends on the speed. If the pen is writing twice as fast, then the ink is consumed at twice the rate. So, if normally, the pen can write 500 words, that would take a certain amount of time. But if during the first 150 words, the pen was writing twice as fast, then the ink was consumed at twice the rate for that period.\n\nWait, but how does that translate to the total ink used? Let me try to model it with variables.\n\nLet’s denote the normal ink consumption rate as r words per unit time. When the pen is warmer, the rate is 2r words per unit time. However, the total ink capacity is 500 words. Wait, but that might not be the right way to model it. Maybe the total ink is fixed, and the rate at which words are written affects how much ink is used per word.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the pen's ink usage is based on the number of words written, but the speed affects how much time is taken. However, the problem is about how much ink is left after writing 300 words, considering that the first 150 words were written at double speed.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that when the pen is warmer, it uses less ink per word. For example, if you write twice as fast, you might be using half the ink per word. So, the first 150 words used half the ink compared to normal. Then, the next 150 words (from 150 to 300) were written at normal speed, using normal ink per word. Then, the total ink used would be (150 * 0.5) + (150 * 1) = 75 + 150 = 225 words worth of ink. Therefore, remaining ink is 500 - 225 = 275 words. But that seems arbitrary because I assumed that writing twice as fast uses half the ink per word, which is an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pen's ink usage is based on the time it's in use. If the pen is writing twice as fast, then for the same number of words, it takes half the time. Therefore, the ink is consumed at a rate that depends on time. Let me try this approach.\n\nLet’s say the total ink capacity is 500 words. Let’s assume that the pen's ink is consumed at a rate of k words per unit time. When the pen is warmer, the rate is 2k words per unit time. However, the total ink is fixed, so the total time the pen can write is T = 500 / k. But when the pen is warmer, the rate is 2k, so the time to write 150 words would be t1 = 150 / (2k) = 75/k. Then, the remaining time after that would be T - t1 = (500/k) - (75/k) = 425/k. But then, the user wrote 300 words in total. Wait, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total ink is 500 words, and the speed affects how much ink is used per word. If the pen is writing twice as fast, maybe it uses less ink per word. For example, if normally, each word uses 1 unit of ink, then when writing twice as fast, each word uses 0.5 units. Therefore, the first 150 words would use 150 * 0.5 = 75 units, and the next 150 words (written at normal speed) would use 150 * 1 = 150 units. Total used: 75 + 150 = 225 units. Remaining ink: 500 - 225 = 275 units, which would allow writing 275 words. But this is assuming that the ink per word is halved when writing twice as fast, which is an assumption not stated in the problem.\n\nBut the problem says the pen writes twice as fast when warmer. It doesn't say anything about ink usage per word. So, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the total ink is 500 words, and the speed doesn't affect the ink usage. Therefore, writing 300 words would use 300 units of ink, leaving 200 words. But that seems to ignore the friend's comment about the pen's speed. However, the friend's comment might be a red herring, or maybe it's a trick question where the speed doesn't affect the total ink usage.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking how much longer the pen can write after writing 300 words. If the total capacity is 500 words, then 500 - 300 = 200 words left. But the friend's comment about the pen writing twice as fast during the first 150 words might be a distraction. However, that seems unlikely. The problem must be designed to have the friend's comment affect the calculation.\n\nAnother approach: The pen's total ink is 500 words. The first 150 words were written at double speed, so they took half the time compared to normal. Let's assume that the ink is consumed based on time. If the pen is writing twice as fast, then for the same amount of ink, you can write twice as many words. Wait, that might be the key.\n\nLet me think of it as the pen's ink capacity is fixed. If the pen is writing twice as fast, then the same amount of ink would allow writing twice as many words. Therefore, the ink usage rate is inversely proportional to the speed. So, if the pen is writing twice as fast, it uses half the ink per word. Therefore, the first 150 words used half the ink compared to normal. Then, the next 150 words (written at normal speed) used normal ink. Then, the total ink used is (150 * 0.5) + (150 * 1) = 75 + 150 = 225. Therefore, remaining ink is 500 - 225 = 275 words. So, the answer would be 275 words.\n\nBut this is based on the assumption that writing twice as fast uses half the ink per word. Is there a way to verify this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the pen's total ink as a fixed amount. Let's say the pen can write 500 words at normal speed. If the pen is writing twice as fast, then the same amount of ink would allow writing 1000 words, but that's not possible because the total capacity is 500. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the total ink is fixed, and the speed affects how many words you can write in a given time. But the total number of words is still limited by the ink.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to look for similar problems or standard approaches. In some cases, when something works faster, it might consume more or less resource. For example, if a machine works twice as fast, it might use more energy, but in this case, the resource is ink, and the output is words.\n\nIf the pen writes twice as fast, it might be that the same amount of ink is used for the same number of words, but the time taken is halved. Therefore, the total ink used for 150 words is the same whether written quickly or slowly. Therefore, the total ink used for 300 words is 300 units, leaving 200 words. But this ignores the friend's comment, which is probably meant to be part of the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pen's ink is consumed based on the time it's in use. If the pen is writing twice as fast, then for the same number of words, it takes half the time. Therefore, the ink is consumed at a rate that depends on time. Let's say the total ink is 500 words. Let's assume that the pen's ink consumption rate is r words per unit time. When the pen is warmer, the rate is 2r words per unit time. However, the total ink is fixed, so the total time the pen can write is T = 500 / r.\n\nBut when the pen is warmer, the rate is 2r, so the time to write 150 words would be t1 = 150 / (2r) = 75 / r. Then, the remaining time after that is T - t1 = (500 / r) - (75 / r) = 425 / r. But the user wrote 300 words in total. Wait, this seems to not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, the total time to write 300 words would be the time for the first 150 words at double speed plus the time for the next 150 words at normal speed. Let's say the normal speed is s words per unit time. Then, the first 150 words take 150 / (2s) = 75/s units of time. The next 150 words take 150/s units of time. Total time is 75/s + 150/s = 225/s. The total ink used would be the total time multiplied by the ink consumption rate. Wait, but I don't know the ink consumption rate.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to think in terms of the total ink used. If the pen can write 500 words normally, then the total ink is equivalent to 500 words. If during the first 150 words, the pen was writing twice as fast, then the ink used for those 150 words would be less. How much less?\n\nIf writing twice as fast means that the same amount of ink is used for twice as many words, then the ink used for 150 words at double speed would be equivalent to 75 words at normal speed. Therefore, the first 150 words used 75 units of ink, and the next 150 words used 150 units, totaling 225 units. Therefore, remaining ink is 500 - 225 = 275 units, which would allow writing 275 words. This seems to be the same as before.\n\nBut this is based on the assumption that writing twice as fast allows writing twice as many words with the same ink, which is a bit of a stretch. However, this is a common type of problem where the rate of consumption is inversely proportional to the speed. So, if you write twice as fast, you use half the ink per word.\n\nAlternatively, if the pen's ink usage is based on the time it's in use, then writing twice as fast would mean that for the same number of words, the time is halved, so the ink used is also halved. Therefore, the first 150 words used half the ink compared to normal. Then, the next 150 words used normal ink. Total ink used is 75 + 150 = 225, leaving 275.\n\nThis seems to be the most plausible answer, even though the problem is a bit ambiguous. Therefore, the answer would be 275 words.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more words the pen can write after 300 words, we need to account for the pen's **ink consumption rate** during the first 150 words (when it was warmer and writing twice as fast) and the remaining 150 words (at normal speed). Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Assumptions and Logic:**\n1. **Total Ink Capacity:** The pen can write **500 words** in total.\n2. **Ink Usage and Speed:** When the pen is warmer, it writes **twice as fast**, which implies **half the ink is used per word** during this period. This is because the same amount of ink would allow writing **twice as many words** at double speed.\n3. **First 150 Words (Warmer):**  \n   - Ink used = $ \\frac{150}{2} = 75 $ words' worth of ink.\n4. **Next 150 Words (Normal Speed):**  \n   - Ink used = $ 150 $ words' worth of ink.\n5. **Total Ink Used After 300 Words:**  \n   - $ 75 + 150 = 225 $ words' worth of ink.\n6. **Remaining Ink:**  \n   - $ 500 - 225 = 275 $ words' worth of ink.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\nYou can write **275 more words** with the pen. \n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{275}$",
