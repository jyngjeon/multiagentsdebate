    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If red flowers are 1/10 more than yellow flowers, then yellow flowers are 1/__ less than red flowers. I need to figure out what number goes in the blank.\n\nFirst, I should probably set up some variables. Let me call the number of yellow flowers Y. Then, the number of red flowers would be Y plus 1/10 of Y. So that's Y + (1/10)Y, which simplifies to (11/10)Y. So red flowers are 11/10 times the number of yellow flowers.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much less the yellow flowers are compared to the red ones. So if red is 11/10 Y, then yellow is Y. To find out what percentage or fraction less Y is compared to red, I need to calculate the difference between red and yellow, then divide that by the red amount.\n\nThe difference is (11/10 Y) - Y = (1/10 Y). So the difference is 1/10 Y. Now, to find out what fraction this difference is of the red flowers, I take (1/10 Y) divided by (11/10 Y). The Y cancels out, and the 10s cancel too, leaving 1/11. So yellow flowers are 1/11 less than red flowers. Therefore, the blank should be filled with 11.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If red is 11/10 of yellow, then yellow is 10/11 of red. So the difference is 1 - 10/11 = 1/11. Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is 11. So the statement would be yellow is 1/11 less than red. That seems right. Let me test with numbers. Suppose yellow is 10 flowers. Then red is 10 + 1 = 11. So yellow is 10, red is 11. The difference is 1. So 1/11 of red is 1, which matches. So yes, 1/11. Therefore, the answer is 11.\n</think>\n\nIf red flowers are $ \\frac{1}{10} $ more than yellow flowers, let the number of yellow flowers be $ Y $. Then, the number of red flowers is:  \n$$\nR = Y + \\frac{1}{10}Y = \\frac{11}{10}Y\n$$\n\nTo find how much less yellow flowers are compared to red flowers, calculate the difference:  \n$$\nR - Y = \\frac{11}{10}Y - Y = \\frac{1}{10}Y\n$$\n\nNow, express this difference as a fraction of the red flowers:  \n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{10}Y}{\\frac{11}{10}Y} = \\frac{1}{11}\n$$\n\n**Answer:** $ \\frac{1}{11} $  \nThus, yellow flowers are $ \\frac{1}{11} $ less than red flowers. The blank should be filled with **11**.",
