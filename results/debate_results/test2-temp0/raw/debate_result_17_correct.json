    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is: In a town, 60% of the women are married to 80% of the men. What percentage of the total adult population is married?\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The key here is that the percentage of married women and married men are given, and we need to find the percentage of the entire adult population that is married. But wait, how do these percentages relate to each other? Because if 60% of women are married, that means those women are married to some men, right? And those men would be part of the 80% of men who are married. So there's a relationship between the number of married women and married men.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of women as W and the number of men as M. The total adult population would then be W + M. Now, 60% of the women are married, so the number of married women is 0.6W. Similarly, 80% of the men are married, so the number of married men is 0.8M.\n\nBut here's the thing: each marriage involves one man and one woman. So the number of married women should equal the number of married men, right? Because every married woman is married to a man, and every married man is married to a woman. Therefore, 0.6W = 0.8M. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nIf 60% of women are married, that's 0.6W women. Each of these women is married to a man, so the number of married men should be equal to the number of married women. Therefore, the number of married men is also 0.6W. But the problem states that 80% of the men are married, which is 0.8M. Therefore, 0.6W = 0.8M. So this equation must hold.\n\nSo from this equation, we can find the ratio of women to men. Let's solve for W/M. 0.6W = 0.8M => W/M = 0.8 / 0.6 = 4/3. Therefore, W = (4/3)M. So the number of women is 4/3 times the number of men.\n\nNow, the total adult population is W + M = (4/3)M + M = (7/3)M. The total number of married people is the number of married women plus the number of married men. But wait, since each marriage is counted once for a woman and once for a man, but we can't just add them because that would double count. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of married people is the number of married women plus the number of married men, but since each married person is either a woman or a man, but not both. Wait, no, actually, each married person is either a woman or a man, but the total number of married people is the number of married women plus the number of married men. However, since each marriage is between one man and one woman, the number of married women equals the number of married men. Therefore, the total number of married people is 2 * number of married women (or 2 * number of married men). Wait, no. Wait, if there are X married women, then there are X married men, so total married people is X + X = 2X. But in reality, each marriage is one man and one woman, so the total number of married people is 2X, where X is the number of marriages. But in this case, the number of married women is X, and the number of married men is also X. Therefore, total married people is X + X = 2X. But in our case, X is 0.6W or 0.8M. Wait, but earlier we had 0.6W = 0.8M, so X = 0.6W = 0.8M. Therefore, total married people is 2X = 2*(0.6W) = 1.2W or 2*(0.8M) = 1.6M. But since W = (4/3)M, substituting into 1.2W gives 1.2*(4/3)M = (4.8/3)M = 1.6M, which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total number of married people is 1.6M. The total population is (7/3)M. Therefore, the percentage of married people is (1.6M / (7/3)M) * 100% = (1.6 / (7/3)) * 100% = (1.6 * 3 / 7) * 100% = (4.8 / 7) * 100% ≈ 68.57%.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me do the calculation step by step.\n\nTotal married people: 1.6M.\n\nTotal population: (7/3)M ≈ 2.333...M.\n\nSo 1.6 / 2.333... = 1.6 / (7/3) = (1.6 * 3)/7 = 4.8 / 7 ≈ 0.6857, so 68.57%.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can use variables to represent the numbers.\n\nLet me assume that the number of men is M and the number of women is W. From the equation 0.6W = 0.8M, we can express W in terms of M: W = (0.8 / 0.6) M = (4/3)M.\n\nTotal population is W + M = (4/3)M + M = (7/3)M.\n\nTotal married people: since each married woman is married to a man, the number of married people is equal to the number of married women plus the number of married men. But since each marriage is one woman and one man, the number of married women equals the number of married men. Therefore, total married people is 2 * number of married women = 2 * 0.6W = 1.2W. Alternatively, 2 * 0.8M = 1.6M. Since W = (4/3)M, substituting into 1.2W gives 1.2*(4/3)M = 1.6M, which is the same as before.\n\nSo total married people is 1.6M. Total population is (7/3)M. Therefore, the percentage is (1.6M / (7/3)M) * 100% = (1.6 * 3 / 7) * 100% = 4.8 / 7 * 100% ≈ 68.57%.\n\nSo approximately 68.57%, which is 48/7% or exactly 68.571428...%.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using actual numbers. Let's assume some numbers for M and W that satisfy the ratio.\n\nSince W = (4/3)M, let's pick M = 3. Then W = 4. So total population is 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nNumber of married women: 60% of 4 = 2.4. Number of married men: 80% of 3 = 2.4. So that's consistent. Total married people: 2.4 + 2.4 = 4.8. Therefore, percentage is 4.8 / 7 * 100% ≈ 68.57%. Same result.\n\nSo that seems to check out. Therefore, the answer is approximately 68.57%, which is 48/7% exactly. So 48 divided by 7 is approximately 6.857, so 68.57%.\n\nBut let me think again if there's a different interpretation. The problem says \"60% of the women are married to 80% of the men.\" Does that mean that the 60% of women are married to the 80% of men, implying that the number of married women is equal to the number of married men? Which is what I assumed. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different interpretation where the 60% of women are married to 80% of the men, meaning that each of the 60% of women is married to 80% of the men? But that would be a different scenario. For example, if each married woman is married to 80% of the men, but that would be a different calculation. But that seems unlikely. The standard interpretation is that the number of married women is equal to the number of married men, since each marriage is between one man and one woman.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 68.57%, which is 48/7% or exactly 68.571428...%.\n\nSo, converting that to a percentage, it's approximately 68.57%, which can be rounded to 68.57% or expressed as a fraction. But the question asks for the percentage, so likely expects a decimal or fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to express 48/7. Let me compute 48 divided by 7. 7*6=42, 48-42=6, so 6 and 6/7, which is 6.857142..., so 68.571428...%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 68.57%.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the percentage of the total adult population that is married, we analyze the relationship between the number of married women and married men, given that:\n\n- **60% of women are married**  \n- **80% of men are married**  \n\nLet’s denote:  \n- $ W $ = number of women  \n- $ M $ = number of men  \n\n### Step 1: Equating Married Individuals  \nEach marriage involves one woman and one man. Therefore, the number of married women must equal the number of married men:  \n$$\n0.6W = 0.8M\n$$  \nSolving for the ratio of women to men:  \n$$\n\\frac{W}{M} = \\frac{0.8}{0.6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad W = \\frac{4}{3}M\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Total Population  \nThe total adult population is:  \n$$\nW + M = \\frac{4}{3}M + M = \\frac{7}{3}M\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Total Married Individuals  \nThe number of married women is $ 0.6W $, and the number of married men is $ 0.8M $. Since these are equal (as shown earlier), the total number of married individuals is:  \n$$\n\\text{Total married} = 0.6W + 0.8M = 0.6 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}M + 0.8M = \\frac{2.4}{3}M + 0.8M = 0.8M + 0.8M = 1.6M\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Percentage of Married Population  \n$$\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{1.6M}{\\frac{7}{3}M} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{1.6 \\times 3}{7} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\frac{4.8}{7} \\times 100\\% \\approx 68.57\\%\n$$\n\n### Final Answer:  \n$$\n\\boxed{68.57\\%}\n$$\n\nThis means **approximately 68.57% of the total adult population is married**.",
