    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this dice problem. So, the question is about finding the expected number of final counts when rolling a die under certain conditions. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: We roll a die repeatedly, keeping track of the number of rolls. Each time we roll, if the result is even (2, 4, or 6), we reset the count back to zero. If we roll a 1, we stop the process. The question is asking for the expected value of the final count when we stop. Wait, actually, the wording says \"expected number of final counts.\" Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. When they say \"final counts,\" does that mean the count when we stop, which would be the number of rolls before we got a 1? Or is it the count after resetting? Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem states: \"We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one. What is the expected number of final counts?\"\n\nSo, the count is being reset to zero whenever an even number is rolled. The process stops when a 1 is rolled. The \"final counts\" probably refer to the count when the process stops. But when we stop, the count would be the number of rolls since the last reset, right? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's say we start with a count of 0. Each time we roll the die:\n\n- If the result is 1, we stop, and the final count is the current count (which would be the number of rolls since the last reset, but since we just rolled a 1, maybe the count is incremented before checking? Or is the count incremented after the roll? The problem says \"count the number of times we roll.\" So each roll increments the count, and then we check if it's even or 1.\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one.\"\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Start with count = 0.\n\n2. Roll the die. Increment the count by 1 (since we rolled once).\n\n3. Check the result:\n\n   a. If it's 1: stop, the final count is the current count (which is 1, since we just rolled once).\n\n   b. If it's even (2,4,6): reset the count to 0.\n\n   c. If it's odd and not 1 (i.e., 3 or 5): keep the count as is, and continue.\n\nWait, but if we reset the count to zero when we get an even number, does that mean that after rolling an even number, the count is set back to zero, and then we continue? So, for example, if we roll a 2 on the first roll, the count is reset to zero, and then we roll again. But the count is zero, but we have to keep rolling until we get a 1.\n\nWait, but the count is the number of times we've rolled. So if we reset the count to zero, does that mean that the count is now zero, but we still have to continue rolling? So the count is not the number of rolls, but the current count that can be reset. Wait, maybe the count is a separate variable that's being tracked, not the number of rolls. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one. What is the expected number of final counts?\"\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to think of it as follows:\n\n- We have a counter that starts at 0.\n\n- Each time we roll the die, we increment the counter by 1.\n\n- If the result is even, we reset the counter to 0.\n\n- If the result is 1, we stop, and the final count is the value of the counter at that point.\n\nWait, but if we increment the counter first, then check the result. For example:\n\nStart with count = 0.\n\nRoll 1: count becomes 1. If the result is 1, we stop, final count is 1.\n\nIf the result is even (say 2), then we reset count to 0, and continue.\n\nIf the result is 3 or 5, count remains 1, and we continue.\n\nSo the count is the number of consecutive rolls since the last reset (or start) that were not even. Each time we roll an even number, we reset the count to zero, and then continue. The process stops when we roll a 1, and the final count is the count at that moment.\n\nWait, but if we roll a 1, we stop immediately. So the count would be the number of rolls since the last reset, including the current roll? Or is the count reset after the roll?\n\nThis is critical. Let me think of an example.\n\nCase 1: First roll is 1. Then count is 1 (since we rolled once), and we stop. Final count is 1.\n\nCase 2: First roll is 2 (even). Then count is reset to 0. Then we roll again. Suppose the second roll is 1. Then count was 0 before the second roll, but after rolling 1, do we increment the count? Wait, the problem says \"count the number of times we roll.\" So each time we roll, we increment the count. But if we get an even number, we reset the count to zero. So maybe the count is being reset, but the number of rolls is still being tracked. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count is the number of consecutive non-even rolls. So, every time you roll an even number, you reset the streak of non-even rolls. When you roll a 1, you stop, and the final count is the length of the current streak of non-even rolls (which would be the number of rolls since the last even or start, but not including the 1? Or including the 1?).\n\nWait, the problem says \"count the number of times we roll.\" So maybe the count is the total number of rolls, but when you get an even number, you reset that count. But that doesn't make much sense. Let me try to think of it as a counter that is being reset when even numbers are rolled, and the process stops when a 1 is rolled. The final count is the value of that counter when the process stops.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nStart with count = 0.\n\nRoll 1: count becomes 1. If it's 1, stop. Final count is 1.\n\nIf it's even (say 2), reset count to 0. Then roll again.\n\nRoll 2: count becomes 1. If it's 1, stop. Final count is 1.\n\nIf it's even, reset to 0, etc.\n\nIf it's 3 or 5, count remains 1, and we continue.\n\nSo the count is the number of consecutive rolls since the last even number (or start) that are not even. Each time you roll an even number, you reset the count to zero. When you roll a 1, you stop, and the final count is the current count (which would be the number of consecutive non-even rolls before the 1, including the 1? Or not? Wait, if you roll a 1, you stop. So when you roll the 1, you increment the count, then check if it's 1. So the count would be incremented first, then checked. So if you roll a 1, the count is incremented, and then you stop. Therefore, the final count is the count after incrementing, which would be the number of rolls since the last reset, including the current roll (the 1). But since the 1 is the stopping condition, the count would be the number of rolls since the last reset, including the 1. However, if the 1 is rolled, the process stops, so the count is that value.\n\nBut if you roll an even number, you reset the count to zero, but you still have to continue rolling. So the count is reset, but the number of rolls is still being tracked. Wait, but the count is the number of times we roll? No, the problem says \"count the number of times we roll.\" So maybe the count is the total number of rolls, but when you get an even number, you reset that count. That seems odd. Let me try to parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one. What is the expected number of final counts?\"\n\nSo, the count is the number of times we roll. So each time we roll, we increment the count. If we get an even number, we reset the count to zero. So, for example:\n\nStart with count = 0.\n\nRoll 1: count becomes 1. If it's even (say 2), reset count to 0. Then roll again. Now count is 0, but we have to continue. Roll again: count becomes 1. If it's 1, stop. Final count is 1.\n\nBut if we reset the count to zero when we get an even number, then the count is being reset, but the number of rolls is still being tracked. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the count is a separate variable that is being reset, not the total number of rolls. Let me think of it as a counter that is being reset when even numbers are rolled, and the process stops when a 1 is rolled. The final count is the value of that counter when the process stops.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nStart with count = 0.\n\nRoll 1: count becomes 1. If it's 1, stop. Final count is 1.\n\nIf it's even (say 2), reset count to 0. Then roll again. Now count is 0, but we have to continue. Roll again: count becomes 1. If it's 1, stop. Final count is 1.\n\nIf it's even again, reset to 0, etc.\n\nIf it's 3 or 5, count remains 1, and we continue.\n\nSo the count is the number of consecutive rolls since the last even number (or start) that are not even. Each time you roll an even number, you reset the count to zero. When you roll a 1, you stop, and the final count is the current count (which would be the number of consecutive non-even rolls before the 1, including the 1? Or not? Wait, if you roll a 1, you increment the count, then check if it's 1. So the count would be incremented first, then you check. Therefore, if you roll a 1, the count is incremented, and then you stop. Therefore, the final count is the count after incrementing, which would be the number of consecutive non-even rolls since the last reset, including the 1. However, since the 1 is the stopping condition, the count would be that value.\n\nBut if you roll a 1, you stop, so the count is the number of rolls since the last reset, including the 1. However, if you rolled a 1, that's the first roll since the last reset, so the count would be 1. If you had rolled a 3 or 5 before, then the count would be higher.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the expected value of this count when the process stops.\n\nTo model this, let's define E as the expected final count. Let's think recursively.\n\nAt any point, the count can be in a state where it's some value k (the number of consecutive non-even rolls since the last reset). However, since the count resets to zero whenever an even number is rolled, the count can be 0, 1, 2, etc. But when the count is 0, it means that the last roll was even, and we are starting a new streak of non-even rolls.\n\nWait, but when the count is 0, the next roll will increment it to 1, unless it's even again. So maybe we can model this as a Markov chain where the state is the current count, and transitions depend on the die roll.\n\nHowever, since the count can be any non-negative integer, but the probability of having a very high count decreases exponentially, maybe we can find a recursive formula for E.\n\nAlternatively, since the process is memoryless except for the current count, we can define E_k as the expected final count given that the current count is k. Then, our goal is to find E_0, since we start with count 0.\n\nWait, but when we start, the count is 0. However, the first roll will increment the count to 1, unless it's even. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the count starts at 0. Then, we roll the die. If the result is 1, we stop with count 1. If it's even, we reset the count to 0 and continue. If it's 3 or 5, the count becomes 1, and we continue. Wait, but how does the count increment? Is the count incremented before checking the result? Or after?\n\nThis is crucial. Let's clarify:\n\nThe problem says: \"We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll. If we get an even number, we will reset the count to zero. We will stop if we get one.\"\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Start with count = 0.\n\n2. Roll the die. Increment the count by 1 (since we rolled once).\n\n3. Check the result:\n\n   a. If it's 1: stop, final count is the current count.\n\n   b. If it's even: reset the count to 0, and repeat step 2.\n\n   c. If it's odd and not 1 (i.e., 3 or 5): keep the count as is, and repeat step 2.\n\nWait, but if we reset the count to 0, does that mean that the count is set to 0, and then we continue rolling? So, for example, if we roll a 2 (even), we increment the count to 1, then reset it to 0, and then we roll again. So the count is 0, and we roll again, incrementing it to 1 again.\n\nBut this seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the count is incremented after checking the result. Let me think of the process as:\n\n- Start with count = 0.\n\n- Roll the die.\n\n- If the result is 1: stop, final count is count + 1? Or count remains 0?\n\nThis is very ambiguous. The problem statement is not entirely clear on the order of operations: whether the count is incremented before or after checking the result.\n\nBut given the wording: \"We roll a dice and count the number of times we roll.\" So, each time we roll, we count it. So, the count is incremented each time we roll. Then, after rolling, we check if it's even or 1. If it's even, reset the count to zero. If it's 1, stop. So the count is incremented first, then checked.\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\nStart with count = 0.\n\nLoop:\n\n   Roll the die.\n\n   Increment count by 1.\n\n   If the result is 1: stop, return count.\n\n   Else if the result is even: set count to 0.\n\n   Else: continue.\n\nWait, but if we increment the count first, then check. So, for example:\n\nFirst roll: count is 0. Roll the die. Suppose it's 1. Then count is incremented to 1, and since it's 1, we stop. Final count is 1.\n\nIf the first roll is 2: count is incremented to 1, then since it's even, reset count to 0. Then we continue.\n\nSecond roll: count is 0. Roll the die. Suppose it's 3. Increment count to 1. Not even or 1, continue.\n\nThird roll: count is 1. Roll the die. Suppose it's 1. Increment count to 2, then stop. Final count is 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the count is being incremented each time, and when you reset, you set it to 0, but the next roll will increment it again.\n\nBut this seems to make the count not directly related to the number of consecutive non-even rolls, but rather the total number of rolls, with resets. However, the problem says \"count the number of times we roll,\" which might mean that the count is the total number of rolls, but when you get an even number, you reset that count. But that would be strange, because resetting the count would mean that the count is not the total number of rolls, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count is a separate variable that is being reset when even numbers are rolled, and the process stops when a 1 is rolled. The final count is the value of that variable when the process stops.\n\nBut given the problem statement, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that the count is reset when even numbers are rolled, and the process stops when a 1 is rolled, I think the intended interpretation is that the count is the number of consecutive non-even rolls since the last reset (or start). Each time you roll an even number, you reset the count to zero. When you roll a 1, you stop, and the final count is the current count (which would be the number of consecutive non-even rolls before the 1, including the 1? Or not?).\n\nWait, if you roll a 1, you stop. So, if the count is k before rolling, you roll the die, increment the count to k+1, check if it's 1. If yes, stop. So the final count is k+1. But if the result is even, you reset the count to 0, and continue. If it's odd and not 1, you keep the count as k+1.\n\nBut this seems to complicate things. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me define E as the expected final count. Let's consider the process starting with count = 0.\n\nWhen we start, we have count = 0. We roll the die:\n\n- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1: then the count is incremented to 1, and we stop. So the final count is 1.\n\n- With probability 1/2 (since there are three even numbers: 2,4,6), we roll an even number: count is incremented to 1, then reset to 0. Then we continue the process from count = 0.\n\n- With probability 1/3 (rolling 3 or 5), we roll an odd number that's not 1: count is incremented to 1, and we continue the process from count = 1.\n\nWait, but this seems to suggest that the count is being incremented first, then checked. So, the count is incremented, then if it's even, reset to 0. If it's 1, stop. Otherwise, continue.\n\nBut if we start with count = 0, then after the first roll, the count becomes 1, and then we check the result. If it's even, reset to 0, and continue. If it's 1, stop. If it's 3 or 5, continue with count = 1.\n\nSo, the expected value E can be written as:\n\nE = (1/6)*1 + (1/2)*E' + (1/3)*E''\n\nWhere E' is the expected value starting from count = 0 (after resetting), and E'' is the expected value starting from count = 1.\n\nWait, but after rolling an even number, we reset the count to 0, and then continue. So the process is the same as starting over with count = 0. Therefore, E' = E.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at count = 1, and we roll the die again:\n\n- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1: count is incremented to 2, then stop. So final count is 2.\n\n- With probability 1/2, we roll an even number: count is incremented to 2, then reset to 0, and continue. So we go back to count = 0, which has expected value E.\n\n- With probability 1/3, we roll a 3 or 5: count is incremented to 2, and continue with count = 2.\n\nWait, but this seems to suggest that for each count k, we have an expected value E_k, where E_k is the expected final count starting from count = k.\n\nSo, in general, for any count k ≥ 0, the expected value E_k can be defined as:\n\nE_k = (1/6)*(k + 1) + (1/2)*E_0 + (1/3)*E_{k+1}\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nWhen we are at count = k, we roll the die:\n\n- With probability 1/6, we roll a 1: then the count is incremented to k + 1, and we stop. So the final count is k + 1.\n\n- With probability 1/2, we roll an even number: the count is incremented to k + 1, then reset to 0. So we go to count = 0, and the expected value is E_0.\n\n- With probability 1/3, we roll a 3 or 5: the count is incremented to k + 1, and we continue with count = k + 1, so the expected value is E_{k+1}.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation is:\n\nE_k = (1/6)(k + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_{k+1} for k ≥ 0.\n\nBut this seems to be an infinite system of equations. However, we can try to find a pattern or solve it.\n\nOur goal is to find E_0, since we start with count = 0.\n\nLet me write the equation for E_0:\n\nE_0 = (1/6)(0 + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_1\n\nSimilarly, for E_1:\n\nE_1 = (1/6)(1 + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_2\n\nFor E_2:\n\nE_2 = (1/6)(2 + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_3\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like an infinite system, but maybe we can find a general formula for E_k.\n\nLet me assume that for all k ≥ 0, E_k = a * k + b, where a and b are constants to be determined. Let's test this assumption.\n\nAssume E_k = a*k + b.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nE_k = (1/6)(k + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_{k+1}\n\nLeft-hand side: a*k + b\n\nRight-hand side: (1/6)(k + 1) + (1/2)(a*0 + b) + (1/3)(a*(k + 1) + b)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n= (1/6)(k + 1) + (1/2)b + (1/3)(a(k + 1) + b)\n\n= (1/6)k + 1/6 + (1/2)b + (1/3)a(k + 1) + (1/3)b\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= [ (1/6)k + (1/3)a k + (1/3)a ] + [1/6 + (1/2)b + (1/3)b ]\n\n= [ (1/6 + a/3)k + a/3 ] + [1/6 + (5/6)b ]\n\nNow, equate this to LHS: a*k + b.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nFor the coefficient of k:\n\n1/6 + a/3 = a\n\n=> 1/6 = a - a/3 = (2a)/3\n\n=> a = (1/6) * (3/2) = 1/4\n\nFor the constant terms:\n\na/3 + 1/6 + (5/6)b = b\n\nSubstitute a = 1/4:\n\n(1/4)/3 + 1/6 + (5/6)b = b\n\n=> 1/12 + 1/6 + (5/6)b = b\n\nConvert to twelfths:\n\n1/12 + 2/12 = 3/12 = 1/4\n\nSo:\n\n1/4 + (5/6)b = b\n\n=> 1/4 = b - (5/6)b = (1/6)b\n\n=> b = 1/4 * 6 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, if our assumption E_k = a*k + b is correct, then E_k = (1/4)k + 3/2.\n\nBut we need to check if this satisfies the recurrence for all k. Let's verify with k=0.\n\nFor k=0:\n\nE_0 = (1/4)(0) + 3/2 = 3/2\n\nFrom the original equation:\n\nE_0 = (1/6)(0 + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_1\n\nSubstitute E_0 = 3/2 and E_1 = (1/4)(1) + 3/2 = 1/4 + 3/2 = 7/4\n\nSo RHS:\n\n(1/6)(1) + (1/2)(3/2) + (1/3)(7/4) = 1/6 + 3/4 + 7/12\n\nConvert to twelfths:\n\n2/12 + 9/12 + 7/12 = 18/12 = 3/2, which matches E_0 = 3/2. Good.\n\nCheck for k=1:\n\nE_1 = 7/4\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\nE_1 = (1/6)(1 + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_2\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n(1/6)(2) + (1/2)(3/2) + (1/3)E_2\n\n= 1/3 + 3/4 + (1/3)E_2\n\nE_2 = (1/4)(2) + 3/2 = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2\n\nSo RHS = 1/3 + 3/4 + (1/3)(2) = 1/3 + 3/4 + 2/3 = (1/3 + 2/3) + 3/4 = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4, which matches E_1 = 7/4. Good.\n\nSimilarly, check k=2:\n\nE_2 = 2\n\nFrom recurrence:\n\nE_2 = (1/6)(2 + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_3\n\n= (1/6)(3) + (1/2)(3/2) + (1/3)E_3\n\n= 1/2 + 3/4 + (1/3)E_3\n\nE_3 = (1/4)(3) + 3/2 = 3/4 + 3/2 = 9/4\n\nSo RHS = 1/2 + 3/4 + (1/3)(9/4) = 1/2 + 3/4 + 3/4 = 1/2 + 6/4 = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, which matches E_2 = 2. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that E_k = (1/4)k + 3/2 is correct for all k ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, the expected final count when starting from count = 0 is E_0 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the expected number of final counts.\" If the final count is the value of the counter when we stop, which we've modeled as E_0 = 3/2. But let me check with some examples.\n\nFor example, the probability of stopping on the first roll is 1/6, with final count 1.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, then we reset to 0 and continue. The expected value from there is E_0 = 3/2.\n\nThe probability of rolling a 3 or 5 on the first roll is 1/3, then we have count = 1, and the expected value from there is E_1 = 7/4.\n\nSo, the equation for E_0 is:\n\nE_0 = (1/6)(1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)(7/4)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(1/6)(1) = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667\n\n(1/2)E_0 = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4 = 0.75\n\n(1/3)(7/4) = 7/12 ≈ 0.5833\n\nAdding them up: 0.1667 + 0.75 + 0.5833 ≈ 1.5, which is 3/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the expected final count is 3/2, which is 1.5.\n\nBut wait, let me think if this makes sense intuitively. The process is similar to a Markov chain where we have a counter that resets on even numbers and stops on 1. The expected value being 1.5 seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of it as follows: Each time we have a non-1, non-even roll, we increase the count. The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, which would end the process with count increased by 1. The probability of rolling an even number is 1/2, which resets the count. The probability of rolling a 3 or 5 is 1/3, which increases the count by 1 and continues.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric distribution, but with resets. However, the presence of resets complicates things.\n\nBut according to our earlier derivation, the expected value is 3/2. Let me see if there's another way to derive this.\n\nLet me consider the expected number of times we increment the count before stopping. Wait, but the final count is the number of increments since the last reset, including the stopping roll.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a sequence of trials, where each trial is a run of non-even rolls (excluding 1s) until an even or 1 is rolled.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the recurrence relation and solved it, and verified with examples, I think 3/2 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose we define E as the expected final count starting from count = 0.\n\nWhen we start, we roll the die:\n\n- With probability 1/6, we get 1, and the final count is 1.\n\n- With probability 1/2, we get even, reset to 0, and the expected value is E.\n\n- With probability 1/3, we get 3 or 5, so the count becomes 1, and then we have to continue. Let's call the expected value from count = 1 as E_1.\n\nBut earlier, we found that E_1 = 7/4, and E_0 = 3/2.\n\nBut if we can express E_1 in terms of E_0, maybe we can find another equation.\n\nFrom the recurrence for E_1:\n\nE_1 = (1/6)(1 + 1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_2\n\nBut we also have E_2 = (1/4)(2) + 3/2 = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2.\n\nBut if we assume that E_k = (1/4)k + 3/2, then for any k, E_k = (k + 6)/4.\n\nWait, 3/2 is 6/4, so E_k = (k + 6)/4.\n\nTherefore, E_0 = 6/4 = 3/2, E_1 = 7/4, E_2 = 8/4 = 2, etc.\n\nSo, in general, E_k = (k + 6)/4.\n\nBut how does this relate to the original problem?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a relation between E and E_1.\n\nFrom the equation for E_0:\n\nE_0 = (1/6)(1) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_1\n\nWe can solve for E_1:\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n6E_0 = 1 + 3E_0 + 2E_1\n\n=> 3E_0 - 1 = 2E_1\n\n=> E_1 = (3E_0 - 1)/2\n\nSimilarly, for E_1:\n\nE_1 = (1/6)(2) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_2\n\nMultiply by 6:\n\n6E_1 = 2 + 3E_0 + 2E_2\n\nBut E_2 = (3E_0 - 1)/2 * something? Wait, no. From the general formula, E_2 = (2 + 6)/4 = 8/4 = 2. But if we use the previous relation, we can write E_2 in terms of E_1.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula E_k = (k + 6)/4, then E_1 = 7/4, E_2 = 8/4 = 2, etc.\n\nBut if we use the equation for E_1:\n\nE_1 = (1/6)(2) + (1/2)E_0 + (1/3)E_2\n\nSubstitute E_1 = 7/4, E_0 = 3/2, E_2 = 2:\n\n7/4 = (1/6)(2) + (1/2)(3/2) + (1/3)(2)\n\nCalculate RHS:\n\n(1/3) + (3/4) + (2/3) = (1/3 + 2/3) + 3/4 = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula holds.\n\nTherefore, the expected value starting from count = 0 is 3/2, which is 1.5.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to see this. Suppose we consider that each time we have a non-1, non-even roll, we add 1 to the count, and with some probability, we reset or stop.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as follows: Each time we roll, there's a 1/6 chance to stop with count increased by 1, a 1/2 chance to reset, and a 1/3 chance to continue with count increased by 1.\n\nBut this seems similar to a geometric distribution where each \"success\" (stopping) has probability p = 1/6, but with resets.\n\nHowever, the presence of resets complicates the expectation.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the expected value E as follows:\n\nWhen we start, we have E = expected final count.\n\nOn the first roll:\n\n- With probability 1/6, we stop with count 1.\n\n- With probability 1/2, we reset and have expected value E again.\n\n- With probability 1/3, we have count 1 and then continue, which would have expected value E_1.\n\nBut we need to relate E_1 to E.\n\nFrom earlier, we have E_1 = (3E - 1)/2.\n\nBut if we can find another equation involving E_1 and E, we can solve for E.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula E_k = (k + 6)/4, then E_0 = 6/",
