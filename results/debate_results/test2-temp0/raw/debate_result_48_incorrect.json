    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the probability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes, given that there's a 95% chance of seeing one in thirty minutes. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, the question is about probability over different time intervals. The key here is probably to model the occurrence of vehicles as a Poisson process, where events happen independently at a constant average rate. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe it's a binomial probability problem? Let me think.\n\nIf the probability of seeing at least one vehicle in thirty minutes is 95%, then the probability of not seeing any vehicle in thirty minutes is 5%. If I can find the rate per minute, I can then calculate the probability for ten minutes. \n\nAssuming that the events are independent and the rate is constant, then the probability of not seeing a vehicle in thirty minutes would be the product of the probabilities of not seeing a vehicle in each minute. Wait, but if I model it as a Poisson process, the probability of zero events in time t is e^(-λt), where λ is the rate parameter. \n\nSo, if P(no vehicle in 30 minutes) = e^(-λ*30) = 0.05. Then solving for λ would give me λ = -ln(0.05)/30. Once I have λ, then the probability of seeing at least one vehicle in ten minutes would be 1 - e^(-λ*10). \n\nAlternatively, if I use the binomial approach, assuming that each minute has a probability p of a vehicle, then the probability of no vehicles in 30 minutes is (1 - p)^30 = 0.05. Then solving for p would be (0.05)^(1/30) - 1. Then the probability of at least one vehicle in ten minutes would be 1 - (1 - p)^10. \n\nBut which model is more appropriate here? The Poisson process is often used for events that happen randomly and independently over time, which seems to fit a vehicle arrival scenario. However, the binomial approach assumes that each time interval (minute) has a fixed probability of an event, which might be a simplification. \n\nWait, but if the time intervals are very small, the Poisson process approximates the binomial distribution. So maybe both approaches are similar here. Let me check the math for both.\n\nFirst, Poisson approach:\n\nP(no vehicle in 30 min) = e^(-λ*30) = 0.05\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\n-λ*30 = ln(0.05)\n\nSo λ = -ln(0.05)/30 ≈ -(-2.9957)/30 ≈ 0.09986 per minute.\n\nThen, for ten minutes:\n\nP(no vehicle in 10 min) = e^(-λ*10) = e^(-0.09986*10) ≈ e^(-0.9986) ≈ 0.368. Therefore, the probability of seeing at least one vehicle is 1 - 0.368 ≈ 0.632 or 63.2%.\n\nNow, binomial approach:\n\nAssume that each minute has a probability p of a vehicle. Then, the probability of no vehicles in 30 minutes is (1 - p)^30 = 0.05. Solving for p:\n\n(1 - p)^30 = 0.05\n\nTake 30th root:\n\n1 - p = 0.05^(1/30)\n\nCalculate 0.05^(1/30). Let me compute that. ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957, divided by 30 is ≈ -0.09986. Then exponentiate: e^(-0.09986) ≈ 0.905. Therefore, 1 - p ≈ 0.905, so p ≈ 0.095. \n\nThen, the probability of at least one vehicle in ten minutes is 1 - (1 - p)^10 = 1 - (0.905)^10. Let's compute that. 0.905^10. Let me approximate. ln(0.905) ≈ -0.0998, multiplied by 10 is -0.998, exponentiate gives e^(-0.998) ≈ 0.368. So 1 - 0.368 ≈ 0.632, same as the Poisson result. \n\nWait, that's interesting. Both methods give the same result here. Because when you take the binomial approach with small p and large n, it approximates the Poisson distribution. But in this case, even though we're using 30 minutes, the result is the same. So maybe the answer is approximately 63.2% chance of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes. \n\nBut let me check the exact numbers again. Let me compute 0.05^(1/30). Let me use a calculator. 0.05 is 5%, so taking the 30th root. Let me compute ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957. Divide by 30: -0.099857. Exponentiate: e^(-0.099857) ≈ 0.905. So 1 - p = 0.905, so p ≈ 0.095. Then, for ten minutes, (1 - p)^10 = 0.905^10. Let me compute 0.905^10. \n\nAlternatively, since we saw that in the Poisson case, the probability of no vehicle in ten minutes is e^(-λ*10) = e^(-0.09986*10) ≈ e^(-0.9986) ≈ 0.368. Therefore, 1 - 0.368 ≈ 0.632. \n\nSo both methods give the same answer here. Therefore, the probability is approximately 63.2%. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose that the probability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes is p. Then, the probability of not seeing a vehicle in ten minutes is 1 - p. Then, the probability of not seeing a vehicle in thirty minutes would be (1 - p)^3, since thirty minutes is three ten-minute intervals. Therefore, (1 - p)^3 = 0.05. Solving for p: 1 - p = 0.05^(1/3), so p = 1 - 0.05^(1/3). \n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me compute that. 0.05^(1/3). Let me calculate that. The cube root of 0.05. 0.05 is 5*10^-2. The cube root of 5 is about 1.710, and the cube root of 10^-2 is 10^(-2/3) ≈ 0.2154. So multiplying them: 1.710 * 0.2154 ≈ 0.368. Therefore, 1 - 0.368 ≈ 0.632. So same answer again. \n\nWait, so this third approach also gives the same result. So regardless of whether I model it as Poisson, binomial with per-minute probability, or assuming that thirty minutes is three ten-minute intervals with independent probabilities, I get the same answer. That's interesting. \n\nSo the key assumption here is that the events are independent in each time interval, and the probability of not seeing a vehicle in each interval is the same. Therefore, the probability of not seeing a vehicle in thirty minutes is the cube of the probability of not seeing it in ten minutes. Therefore, solving (1 - p)^3 = 0.05 gives p ≈ 0.632. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 63.2%. \n\nBut let me check the exact value. Let's compute 0.05^(1/3). Let me use logarithms. ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957. Divide by 3: -0.9986. Exponentiate: e^(-0.9986) ≈ 0.368. Therefore, 1 - 0.368 = 0.632. So yes, exactly the same as before. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is approximately 63.2%. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"seeing a vehicle\" in thirty minutes. So that's the probability of at least one vehicle. So the assumption is that the events are independent in each time interval. So if we split the thirty minutes into three ten-minute intervals, the probability of not seeing a vehicle in each is the same, and independent. Therefore, the probability of not seeing any in thirty minutes is the product of not seeing in each ten-minute interval. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 - (0.05)^(1/3) ≈ 63.2%. \n\nAlternatively, if we use the Poisson process, we get the same answer. Therefore, the answer is approximately 63.2%. \n\nBut let me check with exact numbers. Let me compute 0.05^(1/3). Let me use a calculator. \n\n0.05^(1/3) = e^( (ln 0.05)/3 ) ≈ e^(-2.9957/3) ≈ e^(-0.9986) ≈ 0.368. Therefore, 1 - 0.368 = 0.632. \n\nSo, 63.2% is the approximate probability. \n\nBut maybe the exact value is slightly different. Let me compute 0.05^(1/3) more accurately. \n\nLet me use natural logarithm:\n\nln(0.05) = -2.995732273553991\n\nDivide by 3: -0.998577424517997\n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.998577424517997) ≈ ?\n\nWe know that e^(-1) ≈ 0.3678794411714423. \n\nBut -0.998577 is slightly less negative than -1, so the value is slightly higher than e^(-1). Let me compute the difference: -0.998577 - (-1) = 0.001423. So e^(-0.998577) = e^(-1 + 0.001423) = e^(-1) * e^(0.001423) ≈ 0.367879 * (1 + 0.001423) ≈ 0.367879 * 1.001423 ≈ 0.367879 + 0.367879*0.001423 ≈ 0.367879 + 0.000523 ≈ 0.368402. Therefore, 1 - 0.368402 ≈ 0.631598, so approximately 63.16%. \n\nSo about 63.16%, which rounds to 63.2%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 63.2% chance of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and get a different answer. For example, if someone assumes that the rate is linear, so 95% in 30 minutes would be 95%/3 = 31.67% per ten minutes. But that would be incorrect because probabilities don't add linearly. The correct approach is to consider the complement and use exponents. \n\nSo, the key is that the probability of not seeing a vehicle in thirty minutes is the cube of the probability of not seeing it in ten minutes. Therefore, solving for that gives the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 63.2%.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probability of seeing a vehicle in **ten minutes**, given a **95% chance of seeing one in thirty minutes**, we can model the scenario using **independent events** and the **complement rule**. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Assumptions**\n1. **Independence**: The probability of seeing a vehicle in one time interval does not affect another.\n2. **Constant Rate**: The likelihood of a vehicle appearing is consistent over time.\n3. **Complement Rule**: The probability of **not** seeing a vehicle in a given time is the complement of seeing one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Complement**\n- Probability of **not** seeing a vehicle in **30 minutes** = $ 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Model the Time Intervals**\nAssume the 30-minute period is divided into **three independent 10-minute intervals**. Let $ p $ be the probability of **not** seeing a vehicle in **10 minutes**. Then:\n\n$$\np^3 = 0.05\n$$\n\nSolving for $ p $:\n\n$$\np = 0.05^{1/3} \\approx 0.368\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compute the Desired Probability**\nThe probability of **seeing at least one vehicle** in 10 minutes is the complement of not seeing any:\n\n$$\n1 - p = 1 - 0.368 = 0.632\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe probability of seeing a vehicle in **ten minutes** is approximately **63.2%**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works**\nThis approach assumes that the events are independent and the rate is constant, which aligns with a **Poisson process** or **binomial distribution**. Both models yield the same result here, confirming the robustness of the solution.",
