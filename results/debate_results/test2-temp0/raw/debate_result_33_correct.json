    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is: Ankur's brother has two children, and one of them is a boy born on Tuesday. What's the probability that both children are boys? The assumptions are that the chance of having a boy or girl is equal, and the day of birth is equally likely to be any day of the week.\n\nHmm, I remember similar problems before, like the classic \"two children, one is a boy, what's the probability both are boys?\" The answer there is 1/3, right? Because there are four possible combinations: BB, BG, GB, GG. Since we know one is a boy, GG is out, leaving three possibilities, each equally likely. But here, there's an added detail about the day of the week. That must change things.\n\nWait, so the original problem without the day of birth is 1/3. But adding the day of birth might make it different. Let me think. If we know that one of the boys was born on Tuesday, how does that affect the probability?\n\nFirst, let's consider all possible combinations of two children, considering both gender and day of birth. Each child has 2 possibilities for gender (B or G) and 7 for days (Monday to Sunday). So, each child has 14 possibilities. For two children, that's 14 * 14 = 196 total possibilities.\n\nBut we need to consider the condition that at least one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday. So, we need to count how many of these 196 possibilities include at least one boy born on Tuesday, and then how many of those have both children as boys.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model it step by step. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the possible gender combinations for two children are:\n\n1. Boy-Boy (BB)\n2. Boy-Girl (BG)\n3. Girl-Boy (GB)\n4. Girl-Girl (GG)\n\nBut since we know that at least one is a boy born on Tuesday, GG is out. But the original problem is different because it's not just \"at least one boy,\" but \"at least one boy born on Tuesday.\" So, the sample space is different.\n\nWait, in the classic problem, the answer is 1/3 because the sample space is reduced to three possibilities. But here, the added information about the day of birth might make the sample space larger, but also more specific.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's think of each child as having a gender and a day of birth. So, for each child, the probability of being a boy is 1/2, and the probability of being born on Tuesday is 1/7, independent of gender.\n\nBut the problem states that one of the boys was born on Tuesday. So, we need to compute the probability that both are boys, given that at least one is a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nSo, using conditional probability: P(both boys | at least one boy born on Tuesday) = P(both boys and at least one boy born on Tuesday) / P(at least one boy born on Tuesday)\n\nBut since if both are boys, then the event \"at least one boy born on Tuesday\" is equivalent to \"at least one of the two boys was born on Tuesday.\" So, the numerator is P(both boys and at least one born on Tuesday). The denominator is P(at least one boy born on Tuesday), which includes both cases where there are two boys and one is born on Tuesday, and one boy and one girl with the boy born on Tuesday.\n\nSo, let's compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, the numerator: P(both boys and at least one born on Tuesday). The probability that both are boys is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Given that both are boys, the probability that at least one is born on Tuesday. For two boys, the probability that neither is born on Tuesday is (6/7)^2. Therefore, the probability that at least one is born on Tuesday is 1 - (6/7)^2 = 1 - 36/49 = 13/49. Therefore, the numerator is 1/4 * 13/49 = 13/196.\n\nNow, the denominator: P(at least one boy born on Tuesday). This can be calculated as 1 - P(no boys born on Tuesday). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the event is \"at least one boy born on Tuesday,\" which includes cases where there are two boys, one of whom is born on Tuesday, or one boy born on Tuesday and one girl, or two boys both born on Tuesday.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it as follows:\n\nTotal number of possibilities where at least one child is a boy born on Tuesday. Let's think in terms of counting.\n\nEach child can be:\n\n- Boy born on Tuesday (B-Tue)\n- Boy not born on Tuesday (B-not)\n- Girl born on Tuesday (G-Tue)\n- Girl not born on Tuesday (G-not)\n\nBut since we are considering two children, the total possibilities are combinations of these four types.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use probability.\n\nThe probability that a child is a boy born on Tuesday is (1/2)(1/7) = 1/14.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a child is a boy not born on Tuesday is (1/2)(6/7) = 6/14 = 3/7.\n\nGirl born on Tuesday: (1/2)(1/7) = 1/14.\n\nGirl not born on Tuesday: (1/2)(6/7) = 3/7.\n\nBut the event \"at least one boy born on Tuesday\" can be calculated as 1 - P(no boys born on Tuesday). The probability that a child is not a boy born on Tuesday is 1 - 1/14 = 13/14. Therefore, for two children, the probability that neither is a boy born on Tuesday is (13/14)^2. Therefore, the probability of at least one boy born on Tuesday is 1 - (13/14)^2 = 1 - 169/196 = 27/196.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting with the earlier approach. Wait, but earlier I had the numerator as 13/196, and denominator as 27/196, so the probability would be 13/27. But that seems different from the classic problem. Wait, but in the classic problem, the answer is 1/3, but here with the day of birth, it's 13/27. That seems possible.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me recast the problem.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of all possible cases where at least one boy is born on Tuesday. How many such cases are there?\n\nEach child has 14 possibilities (gender and day). So, total 14*14=196.\n\nNumber of cases where at least one child is a boy born on Tuesday: total cases minus cases where no child is a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nNumber of cases where no child is a boy born on Tuesday: For each child, the number of possibilities is 14 - 1 = 13 (since one possibility is boy born on Tuesday). Therefore, 13*13=169. Therefore, the number of cases with at least one boy born on Tuesday is 196 - 169 = 27. So, 27 cases.\n\nNow, how many of these 27 cases have both children as boys?\n\nTo compute that, we need to count the number of cases where both are boys and at least one is born on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, the number of cases where both are boys: each boy has 7 days, so 7*7=49 cases.\n\nFrom these 49 cases, how many have at least one boy born on Tuesday? That's 49 - number of cases where both boys are not born on Tuesday. The number of cases where both boys are not born on Tuesday is 6*6=36. Therefore, the number of cases where both are boys and at least one is born on Tuesday is 49 - 36 = 13.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable cases is 13, and the total number of cases with at least one boy born on Tuesday is 27. Therefore, the probability is 13/27.\n\nSo, the answer is 13/27.\n\nBut wait, in the classic problem without the day of birth, the answer is 1/3. Here, with the added information about the day of birth, the probability is 13/27, which is approximately 0.481, which is slightly less than 1/2. That seems counterintuitive? Wait, but adding more specific information can change the probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nTotal number of cases with at least one boy born on Tuesday: 27.\n\nNumber of those cases where both are boys: 13.\n\nSo, 13/27. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think of another approach. Let's consider the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: Both children are boys. The probability that at least one is born on Tuesday is 1 - (6/7)^2 = 13/49, as before.\n\nCase 2: One boy and one girl. The probability that the boy is born on Tuesday is 1/7. Since there are two possibilities for which child is the boy (first or second), but since we are considering unordered pairs, maybe not. Wait, in the case of one boy and one girl, the probability that the boy is born on Tuesday is 1/7. So, the number of such cases is 2 (since the boy could be first or second) times the probability of boy born on Tuesday and girl born on any day. Wait, but in terms of counting, the number of cases where there is one boy and one girl, and the boy is born on Tuesday.\n\nEach such case would be: (boy born on Tuesday, girl born on any day) or (girl born on any day, boy born on Tuesday). So, for each of these, the number of possibilities is 1 (for the boy on Tuesday) * 7 (for the girl's day) + 7 (for the girl's day) * 1 (for the boy on Tuesday) = 7 + 7 = 14. But wait, but in the total cases, the number of cases where there is one boy and one girl is 2 * 7 * 7 = 98? Wait, no. Wait, total number of cases where one is a boy and one is a girl is 2 * (number of possibilities for boy) * (number of possibilities for girl). Wait, each child has 14 possibilities, but if we consider ordered pairs, then the number of ordered pairs where the first is a boy and the second is a girl is 7 (days for boy) * 7 (days for girl) = 49. Similarly, the number where the first is a girl and the second is a boy is another 49. So total 98. Therefore, the number of cases where there is one boy and one girl and the boy is born on Tuesday is 7 (for the girl's day) + 7 (for the girl's day) = 14? Wait, no. If the boy is born on Tuesday, then for the first child being a boy on Tuesday and the second a girl on any day: 1 (Tuesday) * 7 (girl's days) = 7. Similarly, the second child being a boy on Tuesday and the first a girl on any day: 7 * 1 = 7. So total 14. Therefore, in the case of one boy and one girl, there are 14 cases where the boy is born on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cases with at least one boy born on Tuesday is the cases from two boys (13) plus cases from one boy and one girl (14), totaling 13 + 14 = 27, which matches the previous calculation. Therefore, the probability is 13/27.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 13/27.\n\nBut why is this different from the classic problem? In the classic problem, the answer is 1/3 because the information is \"at least one boy,\" which is less specific. Here, the information is more specific (a boy born on Tuesday), which reduces the sample space in a way that makes the probability closer to 1/2. For example, if the information was \"at least one boy born on a specific day,\" the probability would be different than if it was \"at least one boy.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the first child is a boy born on Tuesday,\" then the probability would be 1/2, because the second child is independent. But since the information is \"at least one,\" it's different.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer is 13/27. Therefore, the probability that Ankur's brother has two boys is 13/27.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that Ankur's brother has two boys, given that one of his two children is a boy born on Tuesday, is **13/27**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Possibilities**: Each child has 14 possible combinations (2 genders × 7 days of the week). For two children, there are $14 \\times 14 = 196$ total possibilities.\n\n2. **Condition**: At least one child is a boy born on Tuesday. This excludes cases where neither child is a boy born on Tuesday. The number of such excluded cases is $13 \\times 13 = 169$ (since each child has 13 non-boy-on-Tuesday possibilities). Thus, the number of valid cases is $196 - 169 = 27$.\n\n3. **Favorable Cases (Both Boys)**: \n   - The number of cases where both children are boys is $7 \\times 7 = 49$ (each boy has 7 possible days).\n   - From these, subtract the cases where neither boy is born on Tuesday: $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n   - Thus, the number of favorable cases is $49 - 36 = 13$.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: \n   $$\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Cases}}{\\text{Total Valid Cases}} = \\frac{13}{27}.\n   $$\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{27}}$",
