    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So there's this classic bridge crossing problem. Four people need to cross a bridge at night, and they have only one torch. The bridge can hold two people at a time, and each person has a different time to cross: 1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes. The goal is to find the shortest total time for all of them to get across.\n\nHmm, I remember that these types of problems usually involve some strategy where the fastest people help shuttle the torch back and forth. But I need to think through the steps carefully.\n\nFirst, let me list the people with their crossing times. Let's call them A (1 min), B (2 min), C (7 min), and D (10 min). The challenge is to get all of them across in the least time possible.\n\nThe key constraints are that only two can cross at a time, and the torch must be carried back and forth. So, every time someone crosses, the torch is on the other side, and someone has to bring it back. Except for the last trip, where the torch doesn't need to be returned.\n\nI think the standard approach here is to have the two fastest people act as the torch bearers. So, maybe A and B go first. Then one of them comes back. Then the two slowest people cross together, and then the other fast person comes back. Then the two fast people cross again. Let me try to outline that.\n\nFirst trip: A and B cross. That takes 2 minutes (since the slower of the two is B). Then A comes back with the torch. That's 1 minute. Total so far: 2 + 1 = 3 minutes.\n\nNext, the two slowest people, C and D, cross together. That would take 10 minutes (since D is the slowest). Then B comes back with the torch. That's 2 minutes. Total now: 3 + 10 + 2 = 15 minutes.\n\nThen A and B cross again. That's 2 minutes. Total time: 15 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nWait, so total time would be 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes? Let me check that again.\n\nFirst trip: A and B cross (2 min). Then A returns (1 min). Then C and D cross (10 min). Then B returns (2 min). Then A and B cross again (2 min). Total: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut I've heard another method where instead of sending the two slowest together, you send the fastest with the slowest, then have the fastest come back. Let me try that approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFirst, A and D cross. That takes 10 minutes. Then A comes back (1 min). Then A and C cross (7 minutes). Then A comes back (1 min). Then A and B cross (2 minutes). Total time: 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21 minutes. That's worse. So that's not better.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe send the two fastest first, then have the second fastest come back. Then send the two slowest, then have the fastest come back. Then the two fastest cross again. Wait, that's similar to the first method.\n\nWait, let me think again. The first method gives 17 minutes. But I think there's a way to get it down to 17 or maybe even lower?\n\nWait, another strategy: Sometimes, it's better to have the fastest person make multiple trips. Let me check if there's a better combination.\n\nAnother possible sequence:\n\nFirst, A and B cross (2 min). A returns (1 min). Then A and C cross (7 min). A returns (1 min). Then A and D cross (10 min). Total time: 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 10 = 21. That's worse than 17.\n\nHmm. So the first method seems better. But let me check another approach where instead of sending the two slowest together, maybe send one slow and one fast, then have the fast come back. Wait, but that might not help.\n\nWait, here's another method I remember. Sometimes, the optimal is to have the two fastest cross first, then one comes back. Then the two slowest cross, then the other fast comes back. Then the two fast cross again. Which is exactly the first method I thought of. So that gives 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17.\n\nBut I think there's a way to get it down to 17 minutes. Wait, but maybe there's a different sequence. Let me think again.\n\nWait, what if we first send A and C across? That would take 7 minutes. Then A comes back (1 min). Then A and D cross (10 min). Then A comes back (1 min). Then A and B cross (2 min). Total: 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. Still worse.\n\nAlternatively, first send A and D (10), then A and C (7). But that would be 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21 again.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the general strategy. The classic problem with four people has two possible optimal strategies depending on the times. The standard solution is to either:\n\n1. Send the two fastest first, then have the fastest return, then send the two slowest, then have the second fastest return, then send the two fastest again. Which gives 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17.\n\nOr\n\n2. Send the fastest with the slowest, then have the fastest return, then the fastest with the next slowest, then have the fastest return, then the two fastest cross. But that seems to take longer, as in the 21 minutes example.\n\nBut in some cases, when the two slowest are very slow, it's better to have them cross together. Because if you have them cross separately, you'd have to have the fast person come back each time, which adds more time. So in this case, since 7 and 10 are both slow, sending them together is better.\n\nSo the first method is better. Therefore, 17 minutes is the answer.\n\nWait, but I've heard that the answer is 17 minutes. Let me check again.\n\nFirst trip: A and B cross (2). A returns (1). Total: 3.\n\nSecond trip: C and D cross (10). B returns (2). Total: 3 + 10 + 2 = 15.\n\nThird trip: A and B cross again (2). Total: 15 + 2 = 17. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way: What if we first send A and C across? No, that would take 7 minutes. Then A returns (1). Then A and D cross (10). Then A returns (1). Then A and B cross (2). Total: 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. So worse.\n\nAnother alternative: What if we first send A and D (10), then A and C (7). Then A returns (1), then A and B (2). Total: 10 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 20? Wait, no, that's not considering the return trips properly. Let me re-express:\n\nFirst trip: A and D cross (10). Then A returns (1). Then A and C cross (7). Then A returns (1). Then A and B cross (2). Total: 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21. Yes, same as before.\n\nSo the first method is better. Therefore, 17 minutes is the minimal time.\n\nBut wait, I think there's another approach where you send A and B first, then B comes back. Then send B and C, then B comes back, then B and D. But that would be:\n\nFirst trip: A and B (2). B returns (2). Total: 4.\n\nSecond trip: B and C (7). B returns (2). Total: 4 + 7 + 2 = 13.\n\nThird trip: B and D (10). Total: 13 + 10 = 23. That's worse.\n\nNo, that's not good. So that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, first send A and C (7), then A returns (1). Then A and D (10), then A returns (1). Then A and B (2). Total: 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. Same as before.\n\nSo the initial method of 17 minutes seems better.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a way to get it lower than 17. Suppose we do:\n\nFirst, A and B cross (2). A returns (1). Then A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Then A and D cross (10). Total: 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 10 = 21. No, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, first send A and C (7). Then B and D cross? Wait, but they need the torch. So if A and C cross, then someone has to bring the torch back. Let's say A comes back. Then A and D cross. Then A comes back. Then A and B cross. That's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, first send A and D (10). Then A and C (7). Then A comes back (1). Then A and B (2). Total: 10 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 20? Wait, but that's not considering the return trips properly. Let me re-express:\n\nFirst trip: A and D cross (10). Then A returns (1). Then A and C cross (7). Then A returns (1). Then A and B cross (2). Total: 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21. Yes, same as before.\n\nSo no improvement.\n\nAnother idea: What if we first send A and B (2). Then B returns (2). Then send B and C (7). Then B returns (2). Then send B and D (10). Total: 2 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 10 = 23. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, first send A and C (7). Then A returns (1). Then A and D (10). Then A returns (1). Then A and B (2). Total: 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. Still worse.\n\nSo the initial method of 17 minutes seems to be the best so far.\n\nWait, but I think there's another approach where you send the two slowest together, but with a different sequence. Let me think again.\n\nFirst, A and B cross (2). A returns (1). Then C and D cross (10). B returns (2). Then A and B cross again (2). Total: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17. Yes, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, what if we first send A and C (7). Then A returns (1). Then A and D (10). Then A returns (1). Then A and B (2). Total: 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. No.\n\nSo 17 is better.\n\nIs there a way to get it lower than 17? Let's think. Suppose we have a different sequence where the two slowest cross first, but that would require someone to bring the torch back. Let's try:\n\nFirst trip: C and D cross (10). Then one of them returns. Let's say C returns (7). Then A and B cross (2). Then A returns (1). Then A and C cross (7). Total time: 10 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 7 = 27. That's worse.\n\nAlternatively, first trip: C and D cross (10). D returns (10). Then A and B cross (2). A returns (1). Then A and D cross (10). Total: 10 + 10 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 33. Worse.\n\nNope, that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe send A and D first, then A and C. But that seems to take longer.\n\nAlternatively, first send A and B (2). Then B and C (7). Then B returns (2). Then B and D (10). Then B returns (2). Then A and B (2). Wait, but that would be:\n\nFirst trip: A and B (2). Then B and C (7). Then B returns (2). Then B and D (10). Then B returns (2). Then A and B (2). Total: 2 + 7 + 2 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 25. No, that's worse.\n\nSo, no improvement.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time seems to be 17 minutes. But I want to make sure there's no other combination.\n\nWait, here's another approach. What if we first send A and C (7). Then A returns (1). Then A and D (10). Then A returns (1). Then A and B (2). Total: 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. Still worse.\n\nAlternatively, first send A and B (2). Then A returns (1). Then A and D (10). Then A returns (1). Then A and C (7). Total: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 7 = 21. Same as before.\n\nSo, no improvement.\n\nAnother thought: What if we send A and B first (2), then B returns (2). Then send B and C (7). Then B returns (2). Then send B and D (10). Total: 2 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 10 = 23. Worse.\n\nSo, the initial method of 17 minutes is the best so far.\n\nWait, but I think I've heard that the answer is 17 minutes. Let me check once more.\n\nYes, the standard solution for this problem with times 1, 2, 7, 10 is indeed 17 minutes. The steps are:\n\n1. 1 and 2 cross (2 min)\n2. 1 returns (1 min)\n3. 7 and 10 cross (10 min)\n4. 2 returns (2 min)\n5. 1 and 2 cross again (2 min)\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be 17 minutes.\n</think>\n\nThe shortest time needed for all four people to cross the bridge is **17 minutes**. Here's the optimal strategy:\n\n1. **1-minute and 2-minute individuals cross together** (2 minutes).  \n2. **1-minute individual returns** with the torch (1 minute).  \n3. **7-minute and 10-minute individuals cross together** (10 minutes).  \n4. **2-minute individual returns** with the torch (2 minutes).  \n5. **1-minute and 2-minute individuals cross again** (2 minutes).  \n\n**Total time**: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = **17 minutes**.  \n\nThis approach minimizes the time by leveraging the fastest individuals (1 and 2 minutes) to shuttle the torch efficiently, ensuring the two slowest individuals (7 and 10 minutes) cross together to avoid redundant trips.",
