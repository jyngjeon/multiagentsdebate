    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking about the percentage of salt when 10 grams of salt is dissolved in 100 grams of water. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that percentage concentration can be calculated in different ways, like mass/volume or mass/mass. Since both the salt and water are given in grams, it's probably a mass/mass percentage. The formula for mass/mass percentage is (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 100. \n\nWait, the solute here is the salt, which is 10 grams. The solvent is water, 100 grams. But the solution is the total mass of solute plus solvent. So the total mass would be 10g + 100g = 110g. Then the percentage would be (10/110) × 100. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 110 is approximately 0.0909, so multiplying by 100 gives about 9.09%. \n\nBut I should double-check if there's another way people might calculate this. Sometimes people mistakenly use the mass of the solvent instead of the solution. If someone does 10g salt divided by 100g water, that would be 10%, but that's incorrect because the solution's total mass is more than the solvent alone. The correct approach is definitely using the total mass of the solution. \n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the salt dissolves completely. If the salt doesn't dissolve, the mass might not be additive, but the question states that we put the salt into the water, so I assume it's fully dissolved. Therefore, the total mass is indeed 110 grams. \n\nSo the answer should be approximately 9.09%, which is roughly 9.1% when rounded. I should make sure there's no confusion between weight/volume and weight/weight. Since both are in grams, weight/weight is the right approach here. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe percentage of salt in the solution is calculated using the **mass/mass percentage** formula:  \n$$\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Mass of Solute}}{\\text{Mass of Solution}} \\right) \\times 100\n$$  \n- **Mass of solute (salt)** = 10 g  \n- **Mass of solvent (water)** = 100 g  \n- **Mass of solution** = 10 g (salt) + 100 g (water) = **110 g**  \n\n$$\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{10}{110} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 9.09\\%\n$$  \n\n**Answer:** The salt concentration is **approximately 9.09%** (not 10%, as the denominator must include the total mass of the solution, not just the solvent).",
