    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the ages of Alok's daughters. So, the problem gives us three hints, and we need to use them step by step. Let me start by recalling the problem again to make sure I have all the details right.\n\nFirst, Alok tells Shyam that the product of his three daughters' ages is 72. Shyam says that's not enough information. Then Alok gives the second hint: the sum of their ages is equal to his house number. Shyam checks the house number but still can't determine the ages. Finally, Alok gives a third hint: the oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. After that, Shyam figures it out. The question is, what is the age of the oldest girl?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The key here is that Shyam couldn't determine the ages even after knowing the product and the sum, which implies that there must be multiple possible age combinations that result in the same sum. The third hint about the oldest girl must resolve that ambiguity.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible triplets of positive integers (since ages are positive integers) whose product is 72. Then, we can look at their sums and see which ones are ambiguous. The fact that Shyam needed the third hint suggests that after the sum, there were still multiple possibilities, but the mention of an \"oldest\" girl (implying there is a single oldest, not twins or something) would eliminate the ambiguity.\n\nSo, let's start by listing all possible triplets (a, b, c) where a ≤ b ≤ c and a*b*c = 72. Let me think of the factors of 72.\n\nFirst, factor 72 into three numbers. Let's start with 1:\n\n1, 1, 72 (product 72)\n1, 2, 36\n1, 3, 24\n1, 4, 18\n1, 6, 12\n1, 8, 9\nThen 2, 2, 18\n2, 3, 12\n2, 4, 9\n2, 6, 6\n3, 3, 8\n3, 4, 6\n\nWait, let me check if I missed any. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 1:\n\n1*1*72 = 72\n1*2*36\n1*3*24\n1*4*18\n1*6*12\n1*8*9\n\nThen starting with 2:\n\n2*2*18\n2*3*12\n2*4*9\n2*6*6\n\nThen 3:\n\n3*3*8\n3*4*6\n\nIs that all? Let me check if there are others. For example, 3*2*12 is same as 2*3*12, which I already have. Similarly, 4*3*6 is same as 3*4*6. So I think that's all the possible triplets where a ≤ b ≤ c.\n\nNow, let's compute the sum for each triplet:\n\n1,1,72: sum is 1+1+72=74\n1,2,36: 1+2+36=39\n1,3,24: 1+3+24=28\n1,4,18: 1+4+18=23\n1,6,12: 1+6+12=19\n1,8,9: 1+8+9=18\n2,2,18: 2+2+18=22\n2,3,12: 2+3+12=17\n2,4,9: 2+4+9=15\n2,6,6: 2+6+6=14\n3,3,8: 3+3+8=14\n3,4,6: 3+4+6=13\n\nNow, the second hint is that the sum is equal to the house number. Shyam knows the house number but still can't determine the ages. That implies that the sum must correspond to more than one triplet. So, we need to look for sums that are not unique. Let's check which sums are repeated.\n\nLooking at the sums:\n\n74: only 1,1,72\n39: only 1,2,36\n28: only 1,3,24\n23: only 1,4,18\n19: only 1,6,12\n18: only 1,8,9\n22: only 2,2,18\n17: only 2,3,12\n15: only 2,4,9\n14: two triplets: 2,6,6 and 3,3,8\n13: only 3,4,6\n\nSo the only sum that is repeated is 14, which corresponds to both (2,6,6) and (3,3,8). Therefore, if the house number was 14, Shyam would not be able to determine the ages because there are two possibilities. All other sums are unique, so if the house number was any of the other sums, Shyam would have been able to figure it out immediately. Therefore, the house number must be 14, and the possible age triplets are (2,6,6) and (3,3,8).\n\nNow, the third hint is that the oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. This implies that there is a single oldest daughter. Let's look at the two possibilities:\n\nFor (2,6,6): the ages are 2, 6, 6. Here, there are two oldest daughters, both aged 6. So there isn't a single oldest; there's a tie.\n\nFor (3,3,8): the ages are 3, 3, 8. Here, the oldest is 8, and there's only one oldest daughter.\n\nTherefore, the mention of \"the oldest girl\" (singular) indicates that there is a unique oldest daughter, which would eliminate the (2,6,6) case because there are two daughters of age 6. Hence, the correct ages must be 3, 3, 8, making the oldest girl 8 years old.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"the oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream.\" If there were two oldest girls (both 6), then there would be two oldest girls. But the hint refers to \"the oldest girl,\" implying a single oldest. Therefore, the triplet must be (3,3,8), so the oldest is 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 8.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible sums. Wait, earlier when I listed the sums, only 14 was repeated. So that's the key. So the house number is 14, and the ambiguity is between (2,6,6) and (3,3,8). The third hint resolves it by indicating there's a single oldest, so 8 is the answer.\n\nYes, that seems right. I think that's the standard solution to this classic puzzle. So the oldest girl is 8 years old.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves deducing the ages of Alok's three daughters based on three sequential hints. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **First Hint (Product of Ages = 72):**  \n   List all possible triplets of positive integers (a, b, c) where $ a \\leq b \\leq c $ and $ a \\times b \\times c = 72 $. These are:  \n   - (1, 1, 72)  \n   - (1, 2, 36)  \n   - (1, 3, 24)  \n   - (1, 4, 18)  \n   - (1, 6, 12)  \n   - (1, 8, 9)  \n   - (2, 2, 18)  \n   - (2, 3, 12)  \n   - (2, 4, 9)  \n   - (2, 6, 6)  \n   - (3, 3, 8)  \n   - (3, 4, 6)  \n\n2. **Second Hint (Sum of Ages = House Number):**  \n   Shyam still cannot determine the ages, meaning the sum must correspond to **multiple** triplets. Calculating the sums:  \n   - (1, 1, 72): 74  \n   - (1, 2, 36): 39  \n   - (1, 3, 24): 28  \n   - (1, 4, 18): 23  \n   - (1, 6, 12): 19  \n   - (1, 8, 9): 18  \n   - (2, 2, 18): 22  \n   - (2, 3, 12): 17  \n   - (2, 4, 9): 15  \n   - (2, 6, 6): 14  \n   - (3, 3, 8): 14  \n   - (3, 4, 6): 13  \n\n   The only repeated sum is **14**, corresponding to (2, 6, 6) and (3, 3, 8). Thus, the house number must be **14**, and the possible age triplets are (2, 6, 6) and (3, 3, 8).\n\n3. **Third Hint (The Oldest Girl Likes Strawberry Ice Cream):**  \n   This implies there is a **single oldest daughter**.  \n   - In (2, 6, 6), there are **two oldest daughters** (both aged 6).  \n   - In (3, 3, 8), there is **one oldest daughter** (aged 8).  \n\n   The mention of \"the oldest girl\" (singular) eliminates the (2, 6, 6) case, leaving **(3, 3, 8)** as the correct triplet.\n\n**Final Answer:** The age of the oldest girl is **8**.",
