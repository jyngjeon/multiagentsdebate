    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of airplanes required to get one plane around the world, with all planes returning safely. Let me start by understanding the problem again.\n\nEach plane can fly exactly half the distance around the world. So, if the full circle is 1 unit, each plane can go 0.5 units on a full tank. They can refuel in flight without any loss, and the only fuel source is the island. The goal is to have one plane make the full trip (1 unit) while all others return safely.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is a classic puzzle, often referred to as the \"around the world in a day\" problem or something similar. The key here is that planes can transfer fuel mid-air, which allows them to extend the range of the main plane by having others carry extra fuel and then transfer it.\n\nLet me think about how fuel transfer works. If two planes take off together, they can share fuel. For example, if two planes each have a full tank (0.5 units), they can fly together for some distance, then one can transfer fuel to the other. But since they need to return, the fuel transfer has to be calculated so that both can make it back.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. Let's consider the distance around the world as 1 unit. Each plane can carry enough fuel to go 0.5 units. So, if a plane goes 0.5 units, it can't go any further without refueling. But with multiple planes, they can support each other.\n\nLet me think about the case where we have two planes. If two planes take off together, they can fly together for a certain distance, then one can transfer fuel to the other. However, since both need to return, the fuel transfer has to be such that after transferring, both have enough fuel to get back.\n\nSuppose they fly together for x distance. Each plane uses x fuel. Then, the total fuel they have is 2*(0.5 - x) = 1 - 2x. If one plane transfers fuel to the other, the receiving plane can take some fuel, but the transferring plane must have enough to return. Let's say the transferring plane gives y fuel to the other. Then, the transferring plane has (0.5 - x - y) fuel left, which needs to be enough to return x distance. So, 0.5 - x - y = x => 0.5 - x - y = x => 0.5 - y = 2x => y = 0.5 - 2x.\n\nThe receiving plane then has (0.5 - x) + y = 0.5 - x + 0.5 - 2x = 1 - 3x fuel. This fuel needs to be enough for the remaining distance to go around the world. Wait, but the total distance is 1 unit. If they have already flown x, then the remaining distance for the main plane would be 1 - x. But the receiving plane can only carry up to 0.5 units of fuel. Wait, no, the receiving plane can carry more fuel if it's transferred, but the problem is that the planes can only carry up to their fuel capacity. Wait, but the problem says each plane has a fuel capacity to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world. So, the fuel capacity is fixed. So, if a plane is transferring fuel, it can't carry more than 0.5 units. Therefore, the receiving plane can't have more than 0.5 units of fuel. Wait, but if you transfer fuel, you can only transfer up to the amount that the receiving plane can hold. So, if the receiving plane already has some fuel, you can't add more than the remaining capacity.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of fuel capacity. Each plane can carry 0.5 units of fuel. So, when two planes take off, they each have 0.5 units. If they fly together for x distance, they each use x fuel. So, they have 0.5 - x fuel left. Then, if one plane transfers fuel to the other, the maximum amount that can be transferred is such that the transferring plane has enough to return. Let's say the transferring plane gives y fuel to the other. Then, the transferring plane has 0.5 - x - y fuel left, which must be equal to the fuel needed to return x distance, which is x. So, 0.5 - x - y = x => y = 0.5 - 2x. The receiving plane then has 0.5 - x + y = 0.5 - x + 0.5 - 2x = 1 - 3x fuel. However, the receiving plane can only hold up to 0.5 units of fuel. Therefore, 1 - 3x ≤ 0.5 => 1 - 0.5 ≤ 3x => 0.5 ≤ 3x => x ≥ 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.\n\nSo, if x is 1/6, then y = 0.5 - 2*(1/6) = 0.5 - 1/3 = 1/6. Then, the receiving plane has 1 - 3*(1/6) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 units of fuel. So, that's exactly the capacity. Therefore, with two planes, they can fly 1/6 distance, transfer fuel, and then the receiving plane has 0.5 units of fuel, which allows it to go another 0.5 units. But the total distance would be 1/6 + 0.5 = 2/3. But the total distance around the world is 1, so the receiving plane can only go 2/3 of the way. That's not enough. Therefore, two planes aren't sufficient.\n\nSo, maybe we need more planes. Let's try with three planes. Let me think about how to coordinate them. Maybe multiple planes can support the main plane at different points.\n\nThis problem is similar to the classic \"jeep problem\" or \"camel and bananas\" problem, where you have to optimize fuel transfer. But in this case, it's about airplanes that can refuel each other mid-air.\n\nI recall that the solution involves multiple planes taking off together, transferring fuel at certain points, and then returning. The key is that each time you add a plane, you can extend the range further.\n\nLet me try to think recursively. Suppose we have n planes. The idea is that each plane can carry fuel for 0.5 units. If multiple planes go out together, they can transfer fuel to each other, allowing one plane to go further while the others return.\n\nFor example, with three planes:\n\nAll three take off together. They fly for a certain distance x. At this point, each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left. Now, two of the planes can transfer fuel to the third plane. However, each of the two planes needs to have enough fuel to return. Let's say each of the two planes gives y fuel to the third plane. Then, each of the two planes has 0.5 - x - y fuel left, which must be equal to x (the fuel needed to return). So, 0.5 - x - y = x => y = 0.5 - 2x. The third plane receives 2y fuel, so its total fuel is 0.5 - x + 2y = 0.5 - x + 2*(0.5 - 2x) = 0.5 - x + 1 - 4x = 1.5 - 5x.\n\nBut the third plane can only carry up to 0.5 units of fuel. Therefore, 1.5 - 5x ≤ 0.5 => 1.5 - 0.5 ≤ 5x => 1 ≤ 5x => x ≥ 0.2.\n\nSo, if x is 0.2, then y = 0.5 - 2*(0.2) = 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1. The third plane then has 1.5 - 5*(0.2) = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 units of fuel. So, that's exactly the capacity. Therefore, the third plane can now continue with 0.5 units of fuel, which allows it to go another 0.5 units. The total distance covered so far is x = 0.2, and then the third plane can go 0.5 units, totaling 0.7 units. But the total distance is 1, so 0.7 is still not enough. Therefore, three planes aren't sufficient either.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different way to coordinate the planes. Maybe multiple trips or multiple fuel transfers. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the planes can meet at different points. For example, some planes can go out, transfer fuel, and return, while others go further. This might require more planes.\n\nI think the standard solution to this problem is that you need 3 planes for the first leg, then 2 planes for the next leg, and so on. But I need to work it out.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem in terms of fuel required at different points. The main plane needs to have enough fuel to go around the world, which is 1 unit. But since each plane can only carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled multiple times.\n\nBut since all planes must return, the fuel that is transferred to the main plane must be provided by other planes that can return. So, each time a plane transfers fuel, it's using up fuel that it would have used to go further, but instead it's transferring it to the main plane.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of \"fuel depots\" where planes can leave fuel at certain points for the main plane to pick up later. However, in this case, the fuel is transferred mid-air.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem in segments. Suppose we divide the journey into segments where planes can meet and transfer fuel.\n\nLet me consider the classic solution. I think the answer is 3 planes, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, no, I think the answer is more than that. Let me check.\n\nIn the classic problem, the minimum number of planes required is 3 for the first half, but I need to think through.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method:\n\nTo get a plane to go 1 unit, it needs 1 unit of fuel. But since each plane can carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled multiple times. However, the refueling has to be done by other planes that can return.\n\nLet me think of the problem as needing to have fuel at certain points along the journey. For example, if we can have fuel depots at certain distances, then the main plane can pick up fuel from those depots.\n\nBut since the planes can only carry 0.5 units, and they can transfer fuel mid-air, the idea is that multiple planes can go out, transfer fuel to the main plane, and then return.\n\nLet me try to model this with equations.\n\nSuppose we have n planes. They all take off together. They fly for a distance x. At this point, each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left. Now, some of the planes will transfer fuel to the main plane and return, while others continue.\n\nBut how many planes are needed? Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me consider that to get a plane to go a distance d, you need to have fuel at that point. The fuel required at distance d is (1 - d) units, because the plane needs to have enough fuel to go from d to 1 (which is 1 - d units). But since the plane can only carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled at d.\n\nBut how do you get that fuel there? That fuel has to be brought by other planes, which then have to return.\n\nThis seems similar to the camel and bananas problem, where the camel has to make multiple trips to carry bananas to a certain point.\n\nIn the camel problem, the number of trips increases the amount of fuel needed. Similarly, here, each time you have to transport fuel to a point, you need multiple planes to carry it, and they have to return, which consumes fuel.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose we want to get fuel to a point x units away from the airport. To do this, we need to have planes that can carry fuel to x and return. Each plane can carry 0.5 units of fuel. To go to x and return, a plane needs 2x fuel. Therefore, the amount of fuel that can be delivered to x by one plane is 0.5 - 2x. However, if multiple planes are used, they can carry more fuel.\n\nWait, but if multiple planes go to x, they can transfer fuel to each other. For example, if two planes go to x, they each use x fuel to get there. Then, they can transfer fuel to each other. But if they need to return, they have to have enough fuel to get back. So, each plane can transfer some fuel to the other, but they have to leave enough for themselves to return.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me look for a pattern or formula.\n\nI remember that in similar problems, the number of planes required is related to the number of segments. For example, to get a plane to go 1 unit, you need to have fuel at certain points, and each segment requires a certain number of planes.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method from the classic problem:\n\nThe minimum number of planes required is 3. Here's how:\n\nThree planes take off together. They fly 1/8 of the way. At this point, each has used 1/8 fuel, so they have 0.5 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel left. Now, two of the planes transfer 1/8 fuel to the third plane. Each of the two planes gives 1/8 fuel, so they each have 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel left, which is enough to return (since they need to fly back 1/8 distance, which uses 1/8 fuel). The third plane now has 3/8 + 2*(1/8) = 5/8 fuel. Then, the two planes return, and the third plane continues.\n\nNow, the third plane has 5/8 fuel. It needs to go the remaining distance, which is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. But 5/8 is less than 7/8, so it's not enough. Therefore, this approach doesn't work. Wait, maybe I did the math wrong.\n\nWait, the total distance is 1 unit. If the plane has flown 1/8, then it needs to go 7/8 more. But it has 5/8 fuel. That's not enough. So, this approach is insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the planes need to meet at different points. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that to get a plane to go around the world, it needs to have fuel at various points. Each time a plane is used to transfer fuel, it can only do so for a limited distance.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of fuel required at different points. Suppose we divide the journey into segments where planes can meet and transfer fuel.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two planes. They take off together, fly for a distance x, then one transfers fuel to the other and returns. The maximum distance the main plane can go is x + (0.5 - x - y), where y is the fuel transferred. Wait, this is similar to the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as needing to have fuel at certain points. For the main plane to go around the world, it needs to have fuel at each point along the way. However, since it can only carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled multiple times.\n\nBut how can other planes help? Each time a plane helps, it can carry fuel to a certain point and then return.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of \"fuel depots\" where multiple planes are used to carry fuel to a depot, then return, allowing the main plane to use that fuel.\n\nIn the camel and bananas problem, the number of trips increases the amount of fuel needed. For example, if you have to move fuel over a distance, the number of trips required depends on the number of depots.\n\nIn this case, maybe we need to calculate how much fuel is needed at each segment.\n\nLet me try to think of it as follows:\n\nTo get the main plane to go a distance d, it needs to have fuel at that point. The fuel required at d is (1 - d) units, because the main plane needs to have enough fuel to go from d to 1 (which is 1 - d units). However, since the main plane can only carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled at d.\n\nBut to get that fuel to d, other planes have to carry it there and return. Each plane can carry 0.5 units of fuel. To go to d and return, a plane needs 2d fuel. Therefore, the amount of fuel that can be delivered to d by one plane is 0.5 - 2d. If multiple planes are used, the total fuel delivered is n*(0.5 - 2d), where n is the number of planes.\n\nBut the fuel needed at d is (1 - d). Therefore, we have:\n\nn*(0.5 - 2d) ≥ (1 - d)\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn ≥ (1 - d)/(0.5 - 2d)\n\nBut this is for a single segment. However, this might not be the right approach because the fuel needed at d is not just (1 - d), but also considering that the main plane might need to be refueled multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, this might be part of a recursive approach where you need to calculate the number of planes required for each segment.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me look for a known solution or think of it step by step.\n\nI recall that the minimum number of planes required is 3. Here's a possible breakdown:\n\n1. Three planes take off together. They fly 1/8 of the way. Each has used 1/8 fuel, so they have 0.5 - 1/8 = 3/8 fuel left.\n\n2. Two of the planes transfer 1/8 fuel to the third plane. Each of these two planes now has 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel left, which is enough to return (since they need to fly back 1/8 distance, which uses 1/8 fuel). The third plane now has 3/8 + 2*(1/8) = 5/8 fuel.\n\n3. The two planes return, and the third plane continues. Now, the third plane has 5/8 fuel. It needs to go the remaining distance, which is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. But 5/8 is less than 7/8, so it's not enough. Therefore, this approach is insufficient.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have more planes. Let's try with more planes.\n\nSuppose we have four planes. Let's try a different approach.\n\nFirst, all four planes take off together. They fly for a distance x. Each uses x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left.\n\nNow, two of the planes transfer fuel to the other two. Let's say each of the two planes gives y fuel to the other two. Wait, this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as multiple stages. For example, first, some planes go out, transfer fuel, and return, then others go further.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem in terms of fuel required at different points.\n\nTo get the main plane to go around the world, it needs to have fuel at each point. However, since it can only carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled multiple times. Each time it is refueled, the fuel has to be brought by other planes that can return.\n\nLet me consider that to get fuel to a point x, you need to have planes that can carry fuel there and return. Each such trip requires 2x fuel (to go and return). Therefore, the amount of fuel that can be delivered to x by one plane is 0.5 - 2x. If you have n planes, the total fuel delivered is n*(0.5 - 2x).\n\nBut the main plane needs to have enough fuel at x to continue. However, this seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as needing to have fuel at multiple points. For example, to get the main plane to go 1/2 way, it needs 0.5 units of fuel. But since it can carry that, it can go there on its own. But to go further, it needs more fuel.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the main plane can only carry 0.5 units, so it can't go beyond 0.5 units without refueling. Therefore, to go around the world, it needs to be refueled at some point before 0.5 units.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as needing to have fuel at 0.5 units. If the main plane can get fuel at 0.5 units, it can then go another 0.5 units to complete the trip. But to get fuel at 0.5 units, other planes need to carry it there and return.\n\nBut to carry fuel to 0.5 units, a plane needs to go 0.5 units and return, which requires 1 unit of fuel. But each plane can only carry 0.5 units. Therefore, it's impossible for a single plane to carry fuel to 0.5 units and return. Therefore, multiple planes are needed to carry fuel to 0.5 units.\n\nLet me calculate how many planes are needed to deliver fuel to 0.5 units.\n\nEach plane can carry 0.5 units. To go to 0.5 units and return, a plane needs 1 unit of fuel. Therefore, each plane can only contribute 0.5 - 1 = -0.5 units, which is impossible. Therefore, it's impossible for any plane to deliver fuel to 0.5 units and return. Therefore, the fuel must be delivered to a point before 0.5 units.\n\nLet me try to find a point x < 0.5 where fuel can be delivered, and then the main plane can go from x to 0.5, then from 0.5 to 1.\n\nWait, but the main plane can only carry 0.5 units. If it gets fuel at x, it can carry enough to go from x to 0.5, which is 0.5 - x units, and then from 0.5 to 1, which is another 0.5 units. So total fuel needed at x is (0.5 - x) + 0.5 = 1 - x. But the main plane can only carry 0.5 units, so it needs to be refueled at x with 1 - x - (fuel already in the plane). Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the main plane needs to have enough fuel at x to go from x to 1, which is 1 - x units. But since it can only carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled at x with (1 - x) - (fuel it already has). But this depends on how much fuel it has when it reaches x.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let me look for a known solution or think of it in terms of multiple stages.\n\nI think the correct answer is 3 planes. Here's a possible explanation:\n\nThree planes take off together. They fly 1/8 of the way. Each has used 1/8 fuel, so they have 3/8 left. Two of the planes transfer 1/8 fuel to the third plane. Now, the third plane has 3/8 + 2*(1/8) = 5/8 fuel. The two planes return with 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel each, which is enough to return (since they need 1/8 fuel to return). The third plane now continues with 5/8 fuel.\n\nNow, the third plane needs to go the remaining distance, which is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. But it only has 5/8 fuel, which is not enough. So, this doesn't work. Therefore, maybe the planes need to meet again.\n\nWait, perhaps after the third plane has 5/8 fuel, it can fly further, and then another plane meets it to transfer more fuel.\n\nLet me try this. Suppose after the first leg, the third plane has 5/8 fuel. It can fly for 5/8 distance, but it needs to go 7/8. So, it can't make it. Therefore, maybe another plane needs to meet it at some point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three planes don't all go together. Maybe two planes go out, transfer fuel, and return, then another plane goes out with the fuel.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me try to find a resource or recall the standard solution.\n\nWait, I think the standard solution involves multiple planes supporting the main plane at different points. For example, the first leg requires multiple planes to transfer fuel, then the next leg requires fewer planes, and so on.\n\nHere's a possible breakdown:\n\nTo get the main plane to go around the world, it needs to be refueled at certain points. Let's say we divide the journey into three segments:\n\n1. From the airport to point A (distance x).\n2. From point A to point B (distance y).\n3. From point B to the airport (distance z).\n\nBut this might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as needing to have fuel at multiple points. For example, to get the main plane to go 1/2 way, it needs 0.5 units of fuel, which it can carry. But to go beyond that, it needs more fuel.\n\nWait, but the main plane can't go beyond 0.5 units without refueling. So, it needs to be refueled at some point before 0.5 units.\n\nLet me think of it as needing to have fuel at 1/4 of the way. If the main plane can get fuel at 1/4, it can then go from 1/4 to 3/4 (which is 0.5 units), and then from 3/4 to 1 (another 0.25 units). But it can only carry 0.5 units, so it needs to have enough fuel at 1/4 to go from 1/4 to 3/4 (0.5 units) and then from 3/4 to 1 (0.25 units). Total fuel needed at 1/4 is 0.75 units. But the main plane can only carry 0.5 units, so it needs to be refueled at 1/4 with 0.75 - (fuel already in the plane). This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the main plane needs to have enough fuel at 1/4 to go from 1/4 to 1, which is 3/4 units. But since it can only carry 0.5 units, it needs to be refueled at 1/4 with 3/4 - (fuel already in the plane). But this seems impossible unless other planes provide the fuel.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look up the standard solution.\n\nWait, I think the answer is 3 planes. Here's how it works:\n\nThree planes take off together. They fly 1/8 of the way. Each has used 1/8 fuel, so they have 3/8 left. Two of the planes transfer 1/8 fuel to the third plane. Now, the third plane has 3/8 + 2*(1/8) = 5/8 fuel. The two planes return with 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel each, which is enough to return (since they need 1/8 fuel to return). The third plane now continues with 5/8 fuel.\n\nNow, the third plane needs to go the remaining distance, which is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. But it only has 5/8 fuel, which is not enough. So, this doesn't work. Therefore, maybe the planes need to meet again.\n\nWait, perhaps after the third plane has 5/8 fuel, it can fly to a point where another plane meets it to transfer more fuel.\n\nLet me try this. Suppose the third plane flies to a point 1/4 of the way. It has 5/8 fuel. To fly from 1/8 to 1/4, it uses 1/8 fuel, so it has 5/8 - 1/8 = 4/8 = 0.5 fuel left. Now, another plane meets it at 1/4. This plane has flown from the airport to 1/4, using 1/4 fuel, so it has 0.5 - 1/4 = 0.25 fuel left. It transfers 0.25 fuel to the main plane, giving the main plane 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 fuel. Now, the main plane can fly from 1/4 to 3/4 (0.5 units), using 0.5 fuel, leaving it with 0.25 fuel. Then, it needs to go from 3/4 to 1, which is 0.25 units, using 0.25 fuel. So, it makes it! But the other plane that transferred fuel now has 0 fuel left, so it can't return. Therefore, this doesn't work because the second plane can't return.\n\nTherefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two planes are needed to support the main plane at 1/4. Let me try:\n\nThree planes take off together. They fly 1/8, transfer fuel as before, leaving the third plane with 5/8 fuel. Then, two more planes take off, fly to 1/8, transfer fuel to the third plane, and return. But this would require more planes.\n\nThis is getting too complex. I think I need to recall that the minimum number of planes required is 3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be 4 or more.\n\nWait, I found a resource in my mind that says the answer is 3 planes. Here's the reasoning:\n\nThree planes take off together. They fly 1/8 of the way. Each has 3/8 fuel left. Two planes transfer 1/8 fuel to the third, giving it 5/8 fuel. The two planes return with 1/4 fuel each. The third plane continues. Now, it needs to go 7/8 more. It can fly 5/8, then needs 2/8 more. So, it can't make it. Therefore, another plane needs to meet it at 1/8 + 5/8 = 3/4? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the third plane flies to 1/4, then another plane meets it. Let me try:\n\nAfter the first leg, the third plane has 5/8 fuel. It flies to 1/4 (which is 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4). It uses 1/8 fuel, so it has 5/8 - 1/8 = 4/8 = 0.5 fuel left. Now, another plane takes off from the airport, flies to 1/4, using 1/4 fuel, so it has 0.5 - 1/4 = 0.25 fuel left. It transfers 0.25 fuel to the main plane, giving it 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 fuel. Now, the main plane can fly from 1/4 to 3/4 (0.5 units), using 0.5 fuel, leaving it with 0.25 fuel. Then, it needs to go from 3/4 to 1, which is 0.25 units, using 0.25 fuel. So, it makes it! But the second plane that transferred fuel now has 0 fuel left, so it can't return. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nTo make this work, the second plane needs to have enough fuel to return. So, if the second plane transfers y fuel to the main plane, it needs to have enough to return. Let's say the second plane meets the main plane at 1/4. The second plane has flown 1/4, using 1/4 fuel, so it has 0.5 - 1/4 = 0.25 fuel left. To return, it needs 1/4 fuel. Therefore, it can only transfer 0.25 - 1/4 = 0 fuel. So, it can't transfer any fuel. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the answer is more than 3 planes. Let me try with 4 planes.\n\nFour planes take off together. They fly 1/8 of the way. Each has 3/8 fuel left. Three of the planes transfer 1/8 fuel to the fourth plane. Each of the three planes now has 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel, which is enough to return (1/8 fuel needed). The fourth plane now has 3/8 + 3*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 fuel. Now, the fourth plane continues. It needs to go 7/8 more. It has 3/4 fuel, which is 6/8. It can fly 6/8, which gets it to 1/8 + 6/8 = 7/8. Then, it needs to go the remaining 1/8, but it has 0 fuel left. So, it can't make it. Therefore, this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, after the fourth plane has 3/4 fuel, it flies to 1/4 (using 1/8 fuel), leaving it with 3/4 - 1/8 = 5/8 fuel. Then, another plane meets it at 1/4. This plane has flown 1/4, using 1/4 fuel, so it has 0.5 - 1/4 = 0.25 fuel left. It transfers 0.25 fuel to the main plane, giving it 5/8 + 1/4 = 7/8 fuel. Now, the main plane can fly from 1/4 to 3/4 (0.5 units), using 0.5 fuel, leaving it with 7/8 - 0.5 = 3/8 fuel. Then, it needs to go from 3/4 to 1, which is 0.25 units, using 0.25 fuel. It has 3/8 = 0.375 fuel, which is enough. So, it makes it! But the second plane that transferred fuel now has 0.25 - 0.25 = 0 fuel, so it can't return. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nTo make the second plane return, it needs to transfer less fuel. Let's say the second plane transfers y fuel to the main plane, leaving itself with enough to return. The second plane has 0.25 fuel. To return, it needs 1/4 fuel. So, it can only transfer 0.25 - 1/4 = 0 fuel. Therefore, no transfer is possible. Hence, this approach fails.\n\nThis is really challenging",
