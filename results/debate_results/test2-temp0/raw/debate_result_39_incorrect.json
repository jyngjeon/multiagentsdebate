    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about distributing 50 white and 50 black balls into two bowls to maximize the probability of picking a white ball when a random bowl is chosen and then a random ball from that bowl. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the selection is two steps: first choosing a bowl at random, then picking a ball from that bowl. So the overall probability would be the average of the probabilities of picking a white ball from each bowl, right? Because each bowl has a 50% chance of being selected.\n\nWait, but maybe not exactly. Let me think. If there are two bowls, the probability of selecting either bowl is 1/2. Then, for each bowl, the probability of picking a white ball is (number of white balls in that bowl) divided by (total balls in that bowl). So the total probability is (1/2)*P(white from bowl 1) + (1/2)*P(white from bowl 2).\n\nSo the goal is to arrange the balls into the two bowls such that this total probability is maximized. How can I maximize that?\n\nI remember something about this problem from probability puzzles. Maybe putting as many white balls as possible in one bowl and then balancing the rest? Let me try to think through an example.\n\nSuppose I put one white ball in the first bowl and the rest in the second bowl. So bowl 1 has 1 white, bowl 2 has 49 white and 50 black. Then the probability would be (1/2)*(1/1) + (1/2)*(49/99). That's 1/2 + (49/198) ≈ 0.5 + 0.247 = 0.747. That seems high. But is that the maximum?\n\nWait, but if I put all white balls in one bowl and all black in the other, then the probability would be (1/2)*(1) + (1/2)*(0) = 0.5. That's worse. So putting one white in one bowl and the rest in the other gives a better chance. But why?\n\nBecause when you have a bowl with only one white ball, you have a 100% chance of getting white from that bowl, and the other bowl has a decent chance. But if you spread out the white balls, maybe you can get higher?\n\nWait, but if you have two bowls with some white and black balls, maybe the average is better. Let me test another distribution. Suppose I put 25 white and 25 black in each bowl. Then the probability would be (1/2)*(25/50) + (1/2)*(25/50) = 0.5*0.5 + 0.5*0.5 = 0.5. That's worse than the previous 0.747.\n\nSo putting one white in one bowl and the rest in the other seems better. But what if I put more white balls in the first bowl? Let's say I put 2 white balls in the first bowl and the rest in the second. Then the probability would be (1/2)*(2/2) + (1/2)*(48/98) = 0.5*1 + 0.5*(48/98) ≈ 0.5 + 0.2449 ≈ 0.7449. That's slightly less than the 0.747 when there was 1 white in the first bowl. So maybe putting one white in the first bowl is better.\n\nWait, but why? Because the second bowl has more black balls. If I put one white in the first bowl, then the second bowl has 49 white and 50 black. The probability from the second bowl is 49/99 ≈ 0.4949. So total is 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(0.4949) ≈ 0.747. If I put two white in the first bowl, then the second bowl has 48 white and 50 black, so 48/98 ≈ 0.4898. So total is 0.5*1 + 0.5*0.4898 ≈ 0.7449. So indeed, the first case is better.\n\nSo maybe the optimal is to have one bowl with one white ball and the other bowl with the remaining 49 white and 50 black. But wait, what if I put one white and zero black in the first bowl, and the rest in the second? That's exactly what I did. So that gives the highest probability.\n\nBut wait, what if I put one white and one black in the first bowl? Then the probability from the first bowl is 1/2, and the second bowl has 49 white and 49 black. Then the total probability is 0.5*(1/2) + 0.5*(49/98) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5. That's worse. So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, if I put one white and some black in the first bowl. Let's say one white and 50 black. Then the first bowl has 1/51 chance of white, and the second bowl has 49 white and 0 black. Then the total probability is 0.5*(1/51) + 0.5*(1) ≈ 0.5*(0.0196) + 0.5 ≈ 0.5098. That's worse than 0.747. So that's not good.\n\nSo the best seems to be putting one white in one bowl and the rest in the other. But why is that? Because you maximize the chance of getting a white from the first bowl (100%) and then have a decent chance from the second bowl. Even though the second bowl has more black balls, the fact that the first bowl is guaranteed to give white when selected gives a higher overall probability.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to get even higher? Let me think. Suppose I put one white in the first bowl and all the black balls in the second bowl. Then the second bowl would have 50 black and 49 white. Wait, but that's the same as before. So the second bowl has 49 white and 50 black. So the probability is 49/99 ≈ 0.4949. So total is 0.5 + 0.5*0.4949 ≈ 0.747.\n\nAlternatively, if I put one white and one black in the first bowl, and the rest in the second. Then the first bowl has 1/2 chance, and the second has 49 white and 49 black, which is 49/98 = 0.5. So total is 0.5*(0.5) + 0.5*(0.5) = 0.5. Worse.\n\nAnother idea: what if I put all the white balls in one bowl and some black in the other? Wait, but that would be 50 white in one bowl and 50 black in the other. Then the probability is 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(0) = 0.5. Which is worse than 0.747.\n\nSo the key seems to be to have one bowl with a single white ball (so that when that bowl is selected, you get white for sure), and the other bowl with the rest of the white and all the black. That way, you have a 50% chance of getting the sure white, and 50% chance of getting a 49/99 chance. Which is better than other distributions.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to have more than one bowl with a high probability? For example, if I have two bowls each with a high proportion of white balls. But since we have to distribute all the balls, if we split the white balls between the two bowls, but also have to put the black balls in there. Let me try.\n\nSuppose I put 25 white and 25 black in each bowl. Then each bowl has 50% chance. So total is 0.5*0.5 + 0.5*0.5 = 0.5. Not better.\n\nAlternatively, if I put 30 white and 20 black in one bowl, and 20 white and 30 black in the other. Then the probabilities would be (30/50) and (20/50). So total is 0.5*(0.6) + 0.5*(0.4) = 0.5. Still 0.5. Same as before.\n\nSo splitting the white and black equally doesn't help. So the best is to have one bowl with a single white, and the rest in the other. But why not have two bowls with single white balls? Wait, but we have 50 white balls. If I put one white in each bowl, then the rest would be 48 white and 50 black in the other bowls? Wait, no. Wait, there are two bowls. If I put one white in each bowl, then the remaining 48 white and 50 black would have to be distributed between the two bowls. But that would mean each bowl has more than one white. But then the probability would be (1/2)*(1/1) + (1/2)*( (48 + 1)/ (48 + 1 + 50) )? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf I put one white in each bowl, then each bowl has one white. Then the remaining 48 white and 50 black need to be distributed. But there are two bowls. So maybe put 48 white and 50 black in one bowl, and the other bowl already has one white. Wait, but that would be 48 white + 50 black in one bowl, and 1 white in the other. Then the total probability is 0.5*(1/1) + 0.5*(48/98) ≈ 0.5 + 0.5*(0.4898) ≈ 0.5 + 0.2449 ≈ 0.7449. Which is slightly less than the 0.747 when we have one white in one bowl and the rest in the other. Because in that case, the second bowl has 49 white and 50 black, so 49/99 ≈ 0.4949. So 0.5 + 0.5*0.4949 ≈ 0.747. So that's better.\n\nSo putting one white in one bowl and the rest in the other is better than putting one white in each bowl. Therefore, the optimal is to have one bowl with one white, and the other bowl with 49 white and 50 black.\n\nBut wait, what if I put one white and zero black in the first bowl, and the rest in the second. That's exactly that. So that gives the maximum probability.\n\nBut let me check another possibility. Suppose I put one white and one black in the first bowl, and the rest in the second. Then the first bowl has 1/2 chance, and the second has 49 white and 49 black. So 49/98 = 0.5. Then total is 0.5*(0.5) + 0.5*(0.5) = 0.5. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, if I put one white and two black in the first bowl, then the first bowl has 1/3 chance, and the second has 49 white and 48 black. So 49/97 ≈ 0.505. Then total is 0.5*(1/3) + 0.5*(0.505) ≈ 0.1667 + 0.2525 ≈ 0.4192. Worse.\n\nSo that's worse. So the best is indeed putting one white in one bowl and the rest in the other. Therefore, the maximum probability is 0.5 + 0.5*(49/99) ≈ 0.747.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to get even higher? Let me think. Suppose I put one white in the first bowl and all the black balls in the second bowl. Then the second bowl has 50 black and 49 white. So the probability from the second bowl is 49/99 ≈ 0.4949. So total is 0.5 + 0.5*0.4949 ≈ 0.747. But if I put one white and some black in the first bowl, but not all the black. Wait, but if I put one white and some black in the first bowl, then the second bowl would have more white and fewer black. But how does that affect the probability?\n\nFor example, if I put one white and 1 black in the first bowl, then the second bowl has 49 white and 49 black. Then the probability is 0.5*(1/2) + 0.5*(49/98) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, if I put one white and 25 black in the first bowl, then the second bowl has 49 white and 25 black. Then the probability is 0.5*(1/26) + 0.5*(49/74). Let's calculate that. 1/26 ≈ 0.0385, 49/74 ≈ 0.6622. So total is 0.5*(0.0385) + 0.5*(0.6622) ≈ 0.01925 + 0.3311 ≈ 0.3503. Worse than 0.747.\n\nSo that's worse. Therefore, the best is to have the first bowl with one white and no black, and the second bowl with the rest. Therefore, the maximum probability is 0.5 + 0.5*(49/99) ≈ 0.747.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a mathematical way to confirm this. Let's denote that we have two bowls. Let's say bowl A has w1 white and b1 black balls, and bowl B has w2 white and b2 black balls. The total white is w1 + w2 = 50, and total black is b1 + b2 = 50. The probability is 0.5*(w1/(w1 + b1)) + 0.5*(w2/(w2 + b2)).\n\nWe need to maximize this expression. How?\n\nOne approach is to use calculus, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since the probability is maximized when one of the terms is as high as possible. Since the first term is 0.5*(probability from bowl A), and the second term is 0.5*(probability from bowl B). To maximize the total, we want to maximize the sum of the two probabilities. However, since the total number of balls is fixed, there's a trade-off.\n\nBut if we can make one of the probabilities 1 (by putting all white in one bowl and no black), but then the other bowl would have the remaining white and all the black. Wait, but if we put one white in bowl A and no black, then bowl B has 49 white and 50 black. So the probability from bowl B is 49/99. So total is 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(49/99) ≈ 0.747.\n\nAlternatively, if we put more than one white in bowl A, say w1 white and 0 black, then bowl B has 50 - w1 white and 50 black. Then the total probability is 0.5*(w1/w1) + 0.5*((50 - w1)/(50 - w1 + 50)) = 0.5*1 + 0.5*((50 - w1)/(100 - w1)).\n\nSo the total probability is 0.5 + 0.5*( (50 - w1)/(100 - w1) ). To maximize this, we need to maximize (50 - w1)/(100 - w1). Let's denote x = w1. Then the expression is (50 - x)/(100 - x). Let's compute its derivative with respect to x.\n\nLet f(x) = (50 - x)/(100 - x). Then f'(x) = [ -1*(100 - x) - (50 - x)*(-1) ] / (100 - x)^2 = [ -100 + x + 50 - x ] / (100 - x)^2 = (-50)/(100 - x)^2. Which is always negative. Therefore, f(x) is decreasing in x. Therefore, to maximize f(x), we need to minimize x. The minimum x is 1 (since we have to put at least one white in bowl A to have a non-zero probability). Therefore, the maximum occurs when x=1, which gives (50 -1)/(100 -1) = 49/99 ≈ 0.4949. Therefore, the total probability is 0.5 + 0.5*(49/99) ≈ 0.747.\n\nTherefore, this is indeed the maximum. So the optimal distribution is to put 1 white ball in one bowl and the remaining 49 white and 50 black balls in the other bowl.\n\nBut wait, what if we put 0 white in one bowl? Then that bowl would have only black balls, and the other bowl has all the white and black. But then the probability would be 0.5*(0) + 0.5*(50/100) = 0.25. Which is worse. So that's not good.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that putting one white in one bowl and the rest in the other gives the maximum probability of approximately 74.7%, which is higher than any other distribution.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize the probability of selecting a white ball, the optimal distribution is to place **1 white ball in one bowl** and **the remaining 49 white balls and all 50 black balls in the other bowl**. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Probability Calculation**:  \n   - The selection process involves two steps:  \n     - A bowl is chosen at random (50% chance for each bowl).  \n     - A ball is then selected at random from the chosen bowl.  \n   - The total probability of picking a white ball is:  \n     $$\n     P = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot P(\\text{white from Bowl 1}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot P(\\text{white from Bowl 2})\n     $$\n\n2. **Optimal Distribution**:  \n   - **Bowl 1**: 1 white ball (no black balls).  \n     - Probability of white: $ \\frac{1}{1} = 1 $.  \n   - **Bowl 2**: 49 white balls and 50 black balls.  \n     - Probability of white: $ \\frac{49}{99} \\approx 0.4949 $.  \n   - Total probability:  \n     $$\n     P = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{49}{99} \\approx 0.5 + 0.247 = 0.747 \\, (74.7\\%)\n     $$\n\n3. **Why This Works**:  \n   - By isolating a single white ball in one bowl, you guarantee a 100% chance of selecting white from that bowl.  \n   - The second bowl, while containing more black balls, still has a decent chance of yielding white (49/99).  \n   - Other distributions (e.g., splitting white and black balls evenly or placing multiple white balls in one bowl) result in lower probabilities due to reduced certainty in either bowl.\n\n4. **Mathematical Justification**:  \n   - If $ x $ white balls are placed in Bowl 1 (with no black balls), the probability becomes:  \n     $$\n     P = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{50 - x}{100 - x}\n     $$  \n   - The term $ \\frac{50 - x}{100 - x} $ decreases as $ x $ increases, so minimizing $ x $ (i.e., $ x = 1 $) maximizes the total probability.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nPlace **1 white ball in one bowl** and **49 white balls and 50 black balls in the other bowl**. This configuration yields the maximum probability of approximately **74.7%** of selecting a white ball.",
