    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is about the chance that at least one match would be found when comparing a murderer's fingerprint with 20,000 innocent people, given that the chance of a false match (a mistake in the fingerprint comparison) is 0.01%. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The police have a murderer's fingerprint from the crime scene. They compare it with 20,000 people, and one of them matches. But all these 20,000 people are actually innocent. The expert says that the chance of a false match (i.e., two different people's fingerprints being mistakenly identified as the same) is 0.01%. So, the question is asking: what's the probability that at least one of these 20,000 innocent people would have a matching fingerprint with the murderer's, purely by chance?\n\nWait, but if all 20,000 are innocent, then the murderer isn't among them. So, the only way a match would occur is if the fingerprint comparison technology made a mistake. So, the problem is essentially asking: if you have 20,000 people, each with a 0.01% chance of a false match with the murderer's fingerprint, what's the probability that at least one of them has a false match?\n\nBut hold on, the 0.01% is the chance that the technology mistakes two fingerprints as the same. So, for each innocent person, the probability that their fingerprint is mistakenly matched to the murderer's is 0.01%, which is 0.0001. \n\nSo, the problem becomes similar to the classic probability question where you have multiple independent trials, and you want the probability of at least one success (in this case, a false match). The formula for that is 1 minus the probability of no successes in all trials.\n\nSo, if each person has a 0.0001 chance of a false match, then the probability that a single person does not have a false match is 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999. \n\nFor 20,000 people, the probability that none of them have a false match would be (0.9999)^20000. Then, the probability of at least one false match is 1 - (0.9999)^20000.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's the right approach. The key here is that each comparison is independent, right? Assuming that the false match probability is independent for each person, which might be a simplification, but given the problem statement, I think that's the assumption we have to make.\n\nSo, calculating (0.9999)^20000. Let me compute that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, we can use the approximation that for small probabilities, the probability of at least one success is approximately equal to the number of trials multiplied by the probability of success. That is, for rare events, the Poisson approximation might be used. The formula is approximately 1 - e^(-λ), where λ is the expected number of matches, which is n*p, where n is 20,000 and p is 0.0001.\n\nSo, λ = 20000 * 0.0001 = 2. Then, the probability of at least one match is approximately 1 - e^(-2). \n\nCalculating e^(-2) is approximately 0.1353, so 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647, so about 86.47%.\n\nBut wait, the exact value would be 1 - (1 - 0.0001)^20000. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nFirst, take the natural logarithm of (0.9999)^20000, which is 20000 * ln(0.9999). Let's compute ln(0.9999). Since ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x^2/2 - x^3/3 - ... for small x. Here, x is 0.0001, so ln(0.9999) ≈ -0.0001 - (0.0001)^2 / 2 - ... which is approximately -0.0001. Therefore, ln(0.9999) ≈ -0.0001. Therefore, 20000 * ln(0.9999) ≈ 20000 * (-0.0001) = -2. Therefore, (0.9999)^20000 ≈ e^(-2) ≈ 0.1353, so 1 - 0.1353 ≈ 0.8647, which is about 86.47%.\n\nSo, the exact value is very close to the Poisson approximation here. Therefore, the probability is approximately 86.47%.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%.\" So, that is, for any two different people, the chance that their fingerprints are mistakenly matched is 0.01%. So, if we have 20,000 people, each compared to the murderer's fingerprint, then each comparison has a 0.01% chance of a false match. Therefore, the number of trials is 20,000, each with probability 0.0001 of a match. Therefore, the expected number of matches is 20,000 * 0.0001 = 2, as before.\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least one match is approximately 1 - e^{-2} ≈ 86.47%.\n\nBut let me check if there's a different interpretation. Suppose that the 0.01% is the probability that a random person's fingerprint matches the murderer's, but that might not be the case. Wait, the problem says \"the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%.\" So, that is, if you take two different people, the chance that the technology says their fingerprints match is 0.01%. Therefore, for each innocent person, the chance that their fingerprint is mistakenly matched to the murderer's is 0.01%, assuming that the murderer is not among the 20,000. Therefore, each of the 20,000 comparisons is an independent trial with 0.01% chance of a false match.\n\nTherefore, the calculation as above is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the 0.01% is the probability that a given person's fingerprint is a match, but that would be different. However, the problem states that the chance of the technology making a mistake is 0.01%, which is the probability that two different fingerprints are considered the same. Therefore, for each innocent person, the chance that their fingerprint is mistakenly matched to the murderer's is 0.01%, so that's 0.0001 per person.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.47%, which is about 86.5%.\n\nBut let me check with exact calculation. Let's compute (1 - 0.0001)^20000. Let me use logarithms again. Let me compute ln(0.9999) more accurately. Let me use the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 - x) around x=0:\n\nln(1 - x) = -x - x^2/2 - x^3/3 - x^4/4 - ... \n\nHere, x = 0.0001, so:\n\nln(0.9999) = -0.0001 - (0.0001)^2 / 2 - (0.0001)^3 / 3 - ... \n\nCalculating the first term: -0.0001\n\nSecond term: -(0.00000001)/2 = -0.000000005\n\nThird term: -(0.000000000001)/3 ≈ negligible.\n\nSo, ln(0.9999) ≈ -0.0001 - 0.000000005 ≈ -0.000100005\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 20000:\n\n20000 * (-0.000100005) = -2.0001\n\nTherefore, (0.9999)^20000 ≈ e^{-2.0001} ≈ e^{-2} * e^{-0.0001} ≈ 0.1353 * (1 - 0.0001) ≈ 0.1353 * 0.9999 ≈ 0.13528647\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.13528647 ≈ 0.86471353, which is approximately 86.47%.\n\nSo, the exact value is very close to the Poisson approximation. Therefore, the answer is approximately 86.47%.\n\nBut the question is asking for the percentage, so rounding to two decimal places, it would be approximately 86.47%, or maybe they expect a more precise answer. However, given that the original probability is given as 0.01%, which is two decimal places, but the answer is likely expected to be around 86.5% or 86.47%.\n\nAlternatively, if we compute (1 - 0.0001)^20000 using a calculator, but since I can't do that here, the approximation is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one match will be produced is approximately 86.47%, which is about 86.5%.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the problem says \"the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%.\" So, that is, for any two different people, the probability that the technology says they match is 0.01%. Therefore, if we have 20,000 people, each compared to the murderer's fingerprint, then each comparison is between the murderer's fingerprint and an innocent person's. So, the probability that the technology says they match is 0.01%, assuming that the murderer is not among the 20,000. Therefore, each of the 20,000 comparisons is an independent trial with 0.01% chance of a false match. Therefore, the calculation is as above.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.47%, which is about 86.5%.\n\nBut let me check if there's a different approach. For example, using the binomial distribution. The probability of at least one success in n trials is 1 - (1 - p)^n. Here, n=20000, p=0.0001. So, 1 - (1 - 0.0001)^20000. As we calculated, that's approximately 86.47%.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the exact value of (1 - 0.0001)^20000, but since 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 20000 is 2e4, so (1 - 1e-4)^{2e4} ≈ e^{-2} as we saw.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting a different answer. Wait, but the question is phrased as: \"the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?\" So, given that the murderer is not among the 20,000, and all are innocent, the only matches would be false positives. Therefore, the probability is as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if the 0.01% is the probability that a random person's fingerprint matches the murderer's, but that would be different. However, the problem states that the chance of the technology making a mistake is 0.01%, which is the probability that two different fingerprints are considered the same. Therefore, the per-comparison error rate is 0.01%, so the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that at least one false match occurs when comparing the murderer's fingerprint with 20,000 innocent individuals, given a 0.01% false match rate per comparison, can be calculated using the complement of the probability of no matches. \n\n1. **Per-Comparison False Match Probability**:  \n   Each comparison has a 0.01% (or 0.0001) chance of a false match.\n\n2. **Probability of No Matches in 20,000 Trials**:  \n   Assuming independence, the probability that none of the 20,000 comparisons result in a false match is:  \n   $$\n   (1 - 0.0001)^{20000} = (0.9999)^{20000}\n   $$\n\n3. **Approximation Using Exponential Function**:  \n   For small probabilities, $ (1 - p)^n \\approx e^{-np} $. Here, $ np = 20000 \\times 0.0001 = 2 $, so:  \n   $$\n   (0.9999)^{20000} \\approx e^{-2} \\approx 0.1353\n   $$\n\n4. **Probability of At Least One Match**:  \n   $$\n   1 - e^{-2} \\approx 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647 \\quad \\text{(or 86.47%)}\n   $$\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe percentage that at least one false match will be produced is approximately **86.5%**.",
