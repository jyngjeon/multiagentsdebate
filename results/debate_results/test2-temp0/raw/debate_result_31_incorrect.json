    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is about a breathalyzer test that sometimes gives false positives. The setup is that 5% of the time, if a driver is sober, the test says they're drunk. But if they're actually drunk, the test never fails, so it always detects them. Also, only 1 in 1000 drivers is drunk. Now, if a driver is stopped at random and the test says they're drunk, what's the probability they're actually drunk?\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic case of conditional probability. Maybe I need to use Bayes' Theorem here. Let me recall Bayes' formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). So, in this case, A is the event that the driver is drunk, and B is the event that the test says drunk. So, we need to find P(Drunk | Test says drunk).\n\nFirst, let's note down the given probabilities. The probability that a driver is drunk, P(Drunk) = 1/1000 = 0.001. The probability that the test says drunk when the driver is sober is 5%, which is P(Test says drunk | Sober) = 0.05. The test never fails to detect a drunk driver, so P(Test says drunk | Drunk) = 1.0.\n\nNow, to apply Bayes' Theorem, I need to compute P(Test says drunk), which is the total probability of the test indicating drunk. This can be calculated by considering both scenarios: the driver is drunk and the test correctly identifies them, or the driver is sober but the test gives a false positive.\n\nSo, P(Test says drunk) = P(Test says drunk | Drunk) * P(Drunk) + P(Test says drunk | Sober) * P(Sober).\n\nWe know P(Drunk) is 0.001, so P(Sober) is 1 - 0.001 = 0.999. Plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(Test says drunk) = (1.0 * 0.001) + (0.05 * 0.999) = 0.001 + 0.04995 = 0.05095.\n\nNow, applying Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(Drunk | Test says drunk) = (1.0 * 0.001) / 0.05095 ≈ 0.001 / 0.05095 ≈ 0.019627, which is approximately 1.96%.\n\nWait, that seems really low. Only about 2% chance that the person is actually drunk even though the test said they are? That seems counterintuitive. But maybe because the base rate of drunk drivers is so low (1 in 1000), even with a 5% false positive rate, the number of false positives outweighs the actual drunk drivers.\n\nLet me check the math again. The total number of drivers is 1000 for simplicity. Out of 1000 drivers, 1 is drunk and 999 are sober. The test will correctly identify the 1 drunk driver. For the 999 sober drivers, 5% will be falsely flagged, which is 0.05 * 999 = 49.95, approximately 50. So total positive tests are 1 + 50 = 51. Out of these 51, only 1 is actually drunk. So the probability is 1/51 ≈ 0.0196 or 1.96%. That matches the earlier calculation. So even though the test is 100% accurate for drunk drivers, the low base rate means that most of the positive tests are false positives. That makes sense now. So the answer is roughly 2%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the driver is actually drunk, given a positive breathalyzer result, is approximately **1.96%** (or about **2%**). This result highlights the importance of **base rates** in probability and the potential for **false positives** to dominate when the prevalence of the condition (drunk driving) is very low.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n1. **Define Events:**\n   - **D**: Driver is drunk.\n   - **¬D**: Driver is sober.\n   - **T**: Breathalyzer test indicates drunk.\n\n2. **Given Probabilities:**\n   - **P(D)** = 1/1000 = 0.001 (base rate of drunk drivers).\n   - **P(¬D)** = 1 - P(D) = 0.999.\n   - **P(T | ¬D)** = 5% = 0.05 (false positive rate).\n   - **P(T | D)** = 100% = 1.0 (no false negatives).\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**\n   $$\n   P(D | T) = \\frac{P(T | D) \\cdot P(D)}{P(T)}\n   $$\n   Where **P(T)** is the total probability of a positive test:\n   $$\n   P(T) = P(T | D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T | ¬D) \\cdot P(¬D)\n   $$\n   Substituting values:\n   $$\n   P(T) = (1.0 \\cdot 0.001) + (0.05 \\cdot 0.999) = 0.001 + 0.04995 = 0.05095\n   $$\n   Then:\n   $$\n   P(D | T) = \\frac{1.0 \\cdot 0.001}{0.05095} \\approx 0.0196 \\, (\\text{or } 1.96\\%)\n   $$\n\n### Intuition:\nEven though the breathalyzer is **perfect at detecting drunk drivers**, the **extremely low base rate** of drunk drivers (1 in 1000) means that **most positive tests are false positives**. For every 1,000 drivers:\n- 1 is drunk (and will be correctly identified).\n- 999 are sober, and 5% of them (≈50) will be falsely flagged.\n- Total positive tests = 1 + 50 = 51.\n- Only **1/51 ≈ 2%** of positive tests are true positives.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe probability that the driver is actually drunk, despite a positive test, is **~2%**, underscoring the critical role of base rates in interpreting diagnostic tests.",
