    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a flock of birds in a V formation. Initially, there are 25 birds on the left and 25 on the right. Then one bird moves from the left to the right. The question is, how many more birds will be on the right side than the left after this move?\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out the numbers after the bird moves. Let me break it down step by step. \n\nOriginally, left side has 25, right side also 25. So total birds are 25 + 25 = 50. If one bird moves from left to right, then the left side will have 25 - 1 = 24 birds. The right side will have 25 + 1 = 26 birds. \n\nNow, the question is asking how many more birds are on the right than the left. So subtract the left count from the right count. That would be 26 (right) minus 24 (left) = 2. So the answer should be 2 more birds on the right side.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again. The original numbers are equal, 25 each. Moving one bird from left to right reduces left by 1 and increases right by 1. So the difference between right and left becomes (25 +1) - (25 -1) = 26 -24 = 2. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nIs there any other factor I need to consider? Like, does the V formation have a central bird or something? The problem says left and right sides, so maybe the V is symmetrical. But the problem doesn't mention any central bird, so I think the total is just 50 birds. Moving one from left to right would make the difference 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that moving one bird would make the difference 1, but actually, since you're subtracting one from left and adding one to right, the difference is 2. So the answer is 2. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me confirm with another approach. Let's say the left side has L birds and the right has R. Initially, L = R =25. After moving one bird, L becomes L-1 and R becomes R+1. The difference is (R+1) - (L-1) = R - L + 2. Since R and L were equal, R - L is 0, so the difference is 2. Yep, that's the same result. \n\nSo the answer should be 2. I don't see any other way this could be interpreted. Unless there's a trick in the wording, but the problem seems straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a flock of birds in a V formation with 25 birds on each side. When one bird moves from the left to the right side:\n\n1. **Initial counts**:  \n   - Left side: 25 birds  \n   - Right side: 25 birds  \n\n2. **After the move**:  \n   - Left side: $25 - 1 = 24$ birds  \n   - Right side: $25 + 1 = 26$ birds  \n\n3. **Difference**:  \n   $26 - 24 = 2$  \n\n**Answer**: The right side will have **2 more birds** than the left side.  \n\n**Key reasoning**: Moving one bird from the left to the right reduces the left count by 1 and increases the right count by 1, creating a **2-bird difference** (since the net change is $+1$ on the right and $-1$ on the left). This is a straightforward arithmetic problem with no hidden complexities.",
