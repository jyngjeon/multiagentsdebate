    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this mouse population problem. So, the question is: starting with one one-month-old mouse, how many mice will there be after 4 months? The rules are that each mouse can produce 6 offspring every month, and they can start reproducing when they're 2 months old. \n\nFirst, I need to track the population month by month. Let me break it down step by step. Let's start with the initial month. The mouse is one month old, so it's not yet old enough to reproduce. That means in the first month, there's only 1 mouse. \n\nNow, moving to the second month. The original mouse is now two months old, which means it can start reproducing. So, in the second month, this mouse will produce 6 offspring. So, the total number of mice would be the original mouse plus the 6 new ones. That's 1 + 6 = 7 mice. Wait, but hold on, the original mouse is still alive, right? So, the total is 7. \n\nNow, the third month. Let's see. The original mouse is now three months old. It can reproduce again, so it will produce another 6 mice. But also, the offspring from the second month are now one month old. They are not yet old enough to reproduce. So, in the third month, only the original mouse is reproducing. So, adding 6 more mice. The total would be 7 (from the previous month) + 6 = 13 mice. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. The original mouse is producing 6 each month starting from month 2. So, in month 2, it produces 6. In month 3, it produces another 6. But the offspring from month 2 are now one month old in month 3. So, they can't reproduce yet. So, yes, only the original mouse is reproducing in month 3. So, total mice would be 7 + 6 = 13. \n\nNow, moving to the fourth month. The original mouse is four months old, so it's still reproducing. The mice born in month 2 are now two months old (since month 2 to month 4 is two months). Wait, no. Let me think. The mice born in month 2 would be one month old in month 3, and two months old in month 4. So, in month 4, those mice (from month 2) are now two months old, so they can start reproducing. \n\nSo, in month 4, the original mouse is reproducing again (producing 6), and the mice from month 2 are now two months old and can reproduce. How many of them are there? In month 2, there were 6 mice born. So, in month 4, those 6 mice are now two months old. Each of them can produce 6 offspring. So, that's 6 mice * 6 = 36 offspring. \n\nSo, adding that to the previous total. The previous total was 13 mice at the end of month 3. Then, in month 4, the original mouse produces 6, and the 6 mice from month 2 produce 6 each. So, total new mice in month 4: 6 + 36 = 42. Therefore, the total mice after month 4 would be 13 + 42 = 55. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. Because the original mouse is still alive, and the mice from month 2 are alive as well. So, the total number of mice before reproduction in month 4 is 13. Then, they reproduce, adding 42. So, total becomes 13 + 42 = 55. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any other reproducing mice. The mice born in month 3 are now one month old in month 4, so they can't reproduce. The original mouse is reproducing, and the ones from month 2 are reproducing. So, that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me track each generation step by step. Maybe I should list each month's population and their ages. \n\nMonth 1: 1 mouse (age 1 month, can't reproduce)\nMonth 2: Original mouse is 2 months old, reproduces, producing 6. Total mice: 1 + 6 = 7. The original mouse is still alive, and the 6 new ones are 1 month old.\nMonth 3: Original mouse is 3 months old, reproduces again (6). The 6 from month 2 are now 2 months old (but wait, in month 3, they are 1 month old? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nWait, when you start with month 1: age 1. Then month 2: age 2. Then month 3: age 3. The mice born in month 2 would be 1 month old in month 3. So, in month 3, they are 1 month old. Therefore, they can't reproduce. So, only the original mouse reproduces. So, adding 6. Total becomes 7 + 6 = 13. \n\nThen, month 4: original mouse is 4 months old, reproduces (6). The mice born in month 2 are now 2 months old (since month 2 to month 4 is 2 months). So, they can reproduce. Each of those 6 mice produces 6. So, 6*6=36. The mice born in month 3 are 1 month old (can't reproduce). So, total new mice in month 4: 6 + 36 = 42. Previous total was 13, so 13 + 42 = 55. \n\nBut wait, the original mouse is still alive, and the mice from month 2 and 3 are also alive. So, the total population is the sum of all existing mice plus the new ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should track each cohort. Let's try that approach. \n\nLet me define each cohort by their birth month. \n\nCohort A: Original mouse, born in month 0 (assuming that the starting point is month 1 as age 1). Wait, maybe it's better to track the months as follows:\n\nStarting at month 1: 1 mouse, age 1.\n\nMonth 2: age 2, reproduces. Produces 6. So, cohort B (born in month 2) has 6 mice.\n\nMonth 3: cohort A is age 3, reproduces again (6). Cohort B is age 1 (can't reproduce). So, cohort C (born in month 3) has 6 mice.\n\nMonth 4: cohort A is age 4, reproduces (6). Cohort B is age 2, can reproduce (each produces 6). Cohort C is age 1 (can't reproduce). So, cohort D (born in month 4) has 6 (from A) + 6*6 (from B) = 6 + 36 = 42.\n\nNow, total mice after month 4 would be the sum of all cohorts:\n\nCohort A: 1 (still alive)\nCohort B: 6 (still alive)\nCohort C: 6 (still alive)\nCohort D: 42 (newborn)\n\nTotal: 1 + 6 + 6 + 42 = 55. \n\nYes, that seems to check out. So, 55 mice after 4 months. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm once more. Because sometimes in these problems, people might think that the original mouse is only reproducing once, but no, the problem says \"every month\" starting when they are 2 months old. So, the original mouse reproduces every month from month 2 onwards. So, in month 2, 3, 4, etc. \n\nSo, in month 2: 6 offspring\nMonth 3: another 6\nMonth 4: another 6\nSo, the original mouse has produced 3 litters: 6 each time. \n\nCohort B (born in month 2) is 2 months old in month 4, so they reproduce once (in month 4). Each of the 6 produces 6, so 36. \n\nCohort C (born in month 3) is 1 month old in month 4, so no reproduction. \n\nCohort D (born in month 4) is 0 months old, so not counted yet. \n\nSo, total mice: original (1) + cohort B (6) + cohort C (6) + cohort D (42) = 55. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is using a Fibonacci-like sequence, but with more offspring. However, since each mouse can produce 6 every month after 2 months, it's more complex. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using a table:\n\nMonth 0: 1 mouse (age 1)\nMonth 1: age 2, reproduces. Total mice: 1 + 6 = 7\nMonth 2: age 3, reproduces. Cohort B (age 1) can't. Total: 7 + 6 = 13\nMonth 3: age 4, reproduces. Cohort B (age 2) reproduces. Cohort C (age 1) can't. So, new mice: 6 (from A) + 6*6 (from B) = 6 + 36 = 42. Total: 13 + 42 = 55.\n\nYes, same result. \n\nSo, the answer should be 55 mice after 4 months.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the reproduction cycle and tracking each cohort of mice month by month, the total number of mice after 4 months is **55**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Month 1**: Start with 1 one-month-old mouse (cannot reproduce).  \n   **Total**: 1 mouse.\n\n2. **Month 2**: The original mouse is 2 months old and reproduces, producing 6 offspring.  \n   **Total**: 1 (original) + 6 (newborns) = **7 mice**.\n\n3. **Month 3**: The original mouse (now 3 months old) reproduces again (6 offspring). The 6 mice born in Month 2 are 1 month old and cannot reproduce.  \n   **Total**: 7 (previous) + 6 (newborns) = **13 mice**.\n\n4. **Month 4**:  \n   - The original mouse (4 months old) reproduces (6 offspring).  \n   - The 6 mice born in Month 2 are now 2 months old and reproduce (each produces 6 offspring: 6 Ã— 6 = 36).  \n   - The 6 mice born in Month 3 are 1 month old and cannot reproduce.  \n   **Newborns**: 6 (from original) + 36 (from Month 2 cohort) = **42 mice**.  \n   **Total**: 13 (previous) + 42 = **55 mice**.\n\n**Answer**: **55 mice** after 4 months.",
