    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is about Alice going out for drinks 9 days out of 10, and she goes to three bars with equal frequency. Bob is trying to find her today but failed after checking two bars. We need to find the probability that Alice is at the third bar.\n\nFirst, let me parse the information. Alice goes out 90% of the time. When she does go out, she picks one of the three bars with equal probability, so each bar has a 1/3 chance. Bob checks two bars and doesn't find her. Now, we need to find the probability that she's at the third bar given that she's out (since if she's not out, she's not at any bar), and that Bob didn't find her in the first two bars.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Bob is trying to find Alice today. However, he fails after going to two bars.\" So, does that mean that Alice is definitely out today? Because if she wasn't out, Bob wouldn't have gone to the bars. But the problem states that Alice goes out 9 days out of 10. So, maybe we need to consider the probability that she is out today, and then given that she is out, the probability she's at the third bar given that Bob didn't find her in the first two.\n\nBut the problem might be assuming that today is a day when Alice is out. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"9 days among 10 days, Alice goes out for drink.\" So, the probability that Alice is out on any given day is 9/10. Then, given that she is out, she goes to one of the three bars with equal frequency. So, each bar has a 1/3 chance. Bob is trying to find her today. He fails after going to two bars. So, the question is, what is the probability that Alice is at the third bar?\n\nBut does the fact that Bob failed after two bars affect the probability? Because if Alice is out, she is at one of the three bars. If Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, then the probability that she is at the third bar would be... Well, if she is out, and she's equally likely to be at any of the three bars, and Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, then the probability that she is at the third bar is 1/(3 - 2) = 1/1? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, if Alice is out, and she is at one of the three bars with equal probability. Bob checks two bars. If he didn't find her in those two, then she must be in the third one. But that would mean the probability is 1. But that seems too straightforward. However, maybe there's a catch here.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is not assuming that Alice is definitely out today. Because Bob is trying to find her today, but he failed. So, maybe the fact that he failed could imply that Alice is out? Wait, no. If Alice is not out, then she's not at any bar, so Bob would fail regardless. So, the failure of Bob doesn't necessarily mean that Alice is out. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities: Alice is out and not out.\n\nBut the problem says \"Bob is trying to find Alice today. However, he fails after going to two bars.\" So, the fact that he failed could be because Alice is not out, or she is out but at the third bar. Therefore, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed is the probability that she is out and at the third bar divided by the probability that she is not out or is out and at the third bar.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me structure it with Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet me define the events:\n\nLet O be the event that Alice is out today.\n\nLet B be the event that Bob fails to find Alice after checking two bars.\n\nWe need to find P(Alice is at third bar | B).\n\nBut actually, the problem is asking for the probability that Alice shows up in the third bar given that Bob failed. However, if Alice is not out, she can't be at any bar. So, the probability that she is at the third bar is zero in that case. Therefore, the probability we need is P(Alice is out and at third bar | B).\n\nBut maybe the problem is assuming that Alice is out today? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Bob is trying to find Alice today. However, he fails after going to two bars.\" So, Bob tried to find her today, but failed. So, the fact that he failed could be because Alice is not out, or she is out but not at the first two bars. Therefore, we need to compute the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed.\n\nSo, using Bayes' theorem, we can write:\n\nP(Alice at third bar | B) = P(B | Alice at third bar) * P(Alice at third bar) / P(B)\n\nBut actually, since Alice can be at the third bar only if she is out. So, maybe we need to consider the joint probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that Alice is out today, given that Bob tried to find her. But that might not be a valid assumption. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context where we know that Alice is out today, because Bob is trying to find her. But that's not necessarily the case. If Alice is not out, Bob would still try to find her but fail. So, the problem is not giving us any information that Alice is out. Therefore, we need to take into account both possibilities.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, compute P(B), the probability that Bob fails to find Alice after checking two bars.\n\nThis can happen in two ways:\n\n1. Alice is not out (probability 1/10), so Bob fails regardless of which bars he checks.\n\n2. Alice is out (probability 9/10), and she is at one of the three bars. Bob checks two bars, and she is not in those two. The probability that she is at the third bar is 1/3, so the probability that she is not in the first two bars is 2/3. Wait, no. If Alice is out, she is at one of the three bars with equal probability. If Bob checks two bars, the probability that she is not in those two is the probability that she is in the third one, which is 1/3. Therefore, if Alice is out, the probability that Bob fails after checking two bars is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = P(not out) * 1 + P(out) * (probability she is not in the two bars Bob checked) = (1/10)*1 + (9/10)*(1/3) = 1/10 + 3/10 = 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nNow, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed is:\n\nP(Alice at third bar and B) / P(B)\n\nBut Alice is at the third bar only if she is out. So, P(Alice at third bar and B) is equal to P(Alice is out and at third bar and Bob failed). Since if she is at the third bar, Bob failed because he checked two other bars. Therefore, this is equal to P(Alice is out) * P(she is at third bar | out) = (9/10) * (1/3) = 3/10.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (3/10) / (4/10) = 3/4.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So, the answer would be 3/4.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that given that Bob failed, the probability that Alice is out is P(out | B) = P(B | out) * P(out) / P(B) = (1/3)*(9/10) / (4/10) = (3/10) / (4/10) = 3/4. Wait, that's the same as before. But then, given that Alice is out, the probability that she is at the third bar is 1/3. But wait, no, because we have to consider that Bob checked two bars and didn't find her. So, given that she is out and Bob failed, the probability that she is at the third bar is 1, because if she is out and Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, she must be at the third one. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf we have the event that Bob failed, which can be due to Alice not being out or Alice being out but at the third bar. So, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed is equal to the probability that she is out and at the third bar divided by the probability that she is not out or is out and at the third bar.\n\nSo, P(Alice at third bar | B) = P(out and at third bar) / [P(not out) + P(out and at third bar)].\n\nWait, but that would be (9/10 * 1/3) / [1/10 + 9/10 * 1/3] = (3/10) / (1/10 + 3/10) = 3/4. So that's the same as before.\n\nBut another way: if we know that Bob failed, then the probability that Alice is out is P(out | B) = P(B | out) * P(out) / P(B) = (1/3 * 9/10) / (4/10) = 3/4. Then, given that she is out, the probability that she is at the third bar is... Well, if she is out, and Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, then she must be at the third bar. Therefore, given that she is out and Bob failed, the probability that she is at the third bar is 1. Therefore, the total probability is P(out | B) * 1 = 3/4. So that's consistent.\n\nBut wait, that seems to suggest that the answer is 3/4. However, another approach might be to think that if Alice is out, and she is equally likely to be at any of the three bars, and Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, then the probability that she is at the third bar is 1, because she can't be at the first two. But that would be if we know that she is out. However, in reality, we don't know for sure that she is out; we only know that Bob failed. Therefore, the probability that she is out is 3/4, and given that, she is at the third bar with probability 1. Therefore, the total probability is 3/4 * 1 = 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that Alice is definitely out today, then the probability would be 1, but that's not the case here. The problem doesn't state that Alice is out, only that Bob tried to find her and failed. Therefore, the answer is 3/4.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's imagine all possibilities.\n\nThere are 10 days. On 9 days, Alice is out. On 1 day, she is not out.\n\nOn the days she is out, she goes to one of three bars with equal probability. So, for each of the 9 days, there's a 1/3 chance she's at each bar.\n\nBob checks two bars. Let's think about the probability that he fails. On days when Alice is not out, he fails. On days when she is out, he fails with probability 1/3 (since she's at one of the three bars, and he checked two, so 1/3 chance she's at the third).\n\nSo, the total probability of failure is (1/10)*1 + (9/10)*(1/3) = 1/10 + 3/10 = 4/10.\n\nNow, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed is the probability that it's a day when she is out and at the third bar, divided by the probability of failure.\n\nThe number of days when she is out and at the third bar is 9*(1/3) = 3 days. The number of days when she is not out is 1 day. So, total days when Bob fails is 3 + 1 = 4 days. Therefore, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed is 3/4. So that's the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3/4, which is 0.75.\n\nBut wait, another way: if we think that given that Bob failed, the probability that Alice is at the third bar is the same as the probability that she is out and at the third bar divided by the probability that she is not out or is out and at the third bar. Which is (9/10 * 1/3) / (1/10 + 9/10 * 1/3) = 3/10 / 4/10 = 3/4. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3/4.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe the problem assumes that Alice is definitely out today, because Bob is trying to find her. But that's not necessarily the case. If Alice is not out, Bob would still try to find her but fail. So, the problem doesn't give us any information that Alice is out, so we have to consider both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where we know that Alice is out today, because Bob is trying to find her. But that's an assumption. However, the problem states that Alice goes out 9 days out of 10, so the prior probability of her being out is 9/10. But the fact that Bob is trying to find her doesn't necessarily change that. Unless the problem implies that Bob is only trying to find her on days when she is out, but that's not stated.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to consider both possibilities: Alice is out or not, leading to the 3/4 probability.\n\nSo, the answer is 3/4, which is 75%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed to find her after checking two bars is **3/4** (or 75%). Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Key Events**:\n   - **O**: Alice is out today (probability = 9/10).\n   - **¬O**: Alice is not out today (probability = 1/10).\n   - **B**: Bob fails to find Alice after checking two bars.\n\n2. **Calculating P(B)**:\n   - If Alice is **not out** (¬O), Bob fails with probability 1.\n   - If Alice is **out** (O), she is at one of the three bars with equal probability (1/3). Bob checks two bars, so the probability he fails is the chance Alice is at the third bar: 1/3.\n   - Total P(B) = P(¬O) * 1 + P(O) * (1/3) = (1/10) + (9/10)(1/3) = **4/10**.\n\n3. **Calculating P(Alice at third bar | B)**:\n   - The probability that Alice is out and at the third bar is P(O) * (1/3) = (9/10)(1/3) = **3/10**.\n   - The probability that Alice is not out is P(¬O) = **1/10**.\n   - Thus, the conditional probability is:  \n     $$\n     \\frac{P(\\text{Alice at third bar and } B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{3/10}{4/10} = \\frac{3}{4}.\n     $$\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}}$",
