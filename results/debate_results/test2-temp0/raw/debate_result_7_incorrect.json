    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking for the maximum number of distinct natural numbers that can add up to 100. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, natural numbers are positive integers, right? So we're talking about numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc. The key here is that they have to be distinct, meaning no repeats. And we want as many of them as possible such that their sum is exactly 100.\n\nI remember that to maximize the number of terms, you want to use the smallest possible numbers because they add up more slowly. For example, if you use 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the sum is n(n+1)/2. So maybe I need to find the largest n such that this sum is less than or equal to 100. Then, if there's a remainder, adjust the largest number to make up the difference.\n\nLet me test this idea. Let's calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers and see when it's just below 100.\n\nFor n=13: 13*14/2 = 91. That's under 100. For n=14: 14*15/2 = 105. That's over 100. So the maximum n where the sum is less than or equal to 100 is 13, with a sum of 91. The difference between 100 and 91 is 9. So if I take the numbers 1 through 13 and then add 9 to the last number (which is 13), making it 13 + 9 = 22. Then the total sum would be 91 -13 +22 = 100. But wait, does that keep all numbers distinct? Let me check. The original numbers are 1,2,...,12,13. If I replace 13 with 22, then the numbers are 1,2,...,12,22. All are distinct. So that gives 13 numbers. But is there a way to get more than 13?\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. If instead of adding 9 to the last number, I can distribute the remaining 9 among the numbers in a way that doesn't create duplicates. But since we already have the smallest numbers, adding to the largest might be the only way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of using 1 through 13, which sum to 91, we can adjust some numbers to make the total sum 100. For example, if we take the numbers 1 through 13, which sum to 91, and then we need 9 more. If we add 1 to the last number, making it 14, but then the sum would be 91 -13 +14 = 92. Still need 8 more. Then add 1 to the next last number, which is 12, making it 13. Wait, but 13 is already in the original set. Oh, that would create a duplicate. So that's not allowed. So maybe instead of adding to the last number, we can replace the largest number with a larger number. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of using 1 through 13, we can use numbers starting from 1 but skip some numbers to make room for the extra. Wait, but that might not help. Let me think again.\n\nThe standard approach for maximum number of distinct numbers is to use the smallest numbers possible. So the sum of 1+2+...+n is n(n+1)/2. We need this sum to be as close to 100 as possible without exceeding it. As we saw, n=13 gives 91, which is 9 less than 100. So if we can adjust the numbers to add that 9 without duplicating any numbers.\n\nOne way is to take the sequence 1,2,...,12, and then instead of 13, use 13 + 9 = 22. That gives us 13 numbers. But is there a way to get 14 numbers?\n\nIf we try n=14, the sum is 105, which is 5 more than 100. So if we can reduce the total by 5 by adjusting some numbers. But how? Since all numbers are distinct, we need to replace some numbers with smaller ones. However, the numbers are already the smallest possible. For example, if we take the numbers 1 through 14, which sum to 105, and we need to reduce the total by 5. To do that, we can subtract 5 from the largest number, making it 14 -5 = 9. But 9 is already in the sequence (since we have numbers up to 14). So that would create a duplicate. Alternatively, subtract 1 from the largest number (14 becomes 13), but 13 is already present. So that's a duplicate. Similarly, subtracting 2 from 14 gives 12, which is already there. So this approach doesn't work because we can't just reduce the largest number without duplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace some of the larger numbers with smaller ones. For example, remove the largest number (14) and add a smaller number that's not already in the set. But the numbers are already 1 through 14. If we remove 14, the sum becomes 105 -14 = 91. Then we need to add numbers to reach 100. But we already have 1 through 13, which sum to 91. So adding 9 would be the same as before. But that would give us 13 numbers again. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, but if we remove 14 and add a number that's not in the set. But the numbers are 1-13 and then adding something else. Wait, but if we remove 14 and add a number that's not in 1-13, but that would be a number larger than 13. But then the sum would be 91 + x, where x is some number not in 1-13. To get 100, x would need to be 9. But 9 is already in the set. So that's not allowed. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe remove multiple numbers and add others. For example, remove 14 and 13, and add numbers that are not in the set. But this seems complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of using consecutive numbers, use numbers with some gaps. For example, if we can have more numbers by skipping some larger numbers and including smaller ones. Wait, but the problem is that the minimal sum for n numbers is 1+2+...+n. If we want to have more numbers, say n=14, the minimal sum is 105, which is already more than 100. Therefore, it's impossible to have 14 distinct natural numbers sum to 100 because even the minimal sum for 14 numbers is 105, which is greater than 100. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct natural numbers is 13.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. Because if the minimal sum for n numbers is n(n+1)/2, and for n=14 it's 105, which is more than 100, so you can't have 14 numbers. Therefore, the maximum is 13. But then how do we adjust the numbers to get the sum to 100? As we did before, by replacing the last number with a larger one. So the answer is 13.\n\nBut let me check again. Suppose someone says, what if we don't use consecutive numbers? For example, maybe skip some small numbers and include larger ones to allow more numbers. Wait, but that would increase the sum. For example, if you skip 1 and use 2,3,...,n, the sum is higher than 1+2+...+n. So that would make the sum even larger, which is worse. Therefore, to minimize the sum for a given number of terms, you need to use the smallest numbers possible. Therefore, the minimal sum for n numbers is 1+2+...+n. Therefore, if that minimal sum is greater than 100, you can't have n numbers. Therefore, the maximum n is the largest n where 1+2+...+n ≤ 100.\n\nSo solving n(n+1)/2 ≤ 100. Let's compute n:\n\nn^2 + n - 200 ≤ 0.\n\nSolving the quadratic equation n^2 +n -200 =0.\n\nDiscriminant D = 1 + 800 = 801.\n\nn = [-1 ± sqrt(801)] / 2. sqrt(801) is approx 28.3. So positive root is ( -1 + 28.3 ) / 2 ≈ 13.65. So n is approximately 13.65. Therefore, the maximum integer n is 13. Hence, the maximum number of distinct natural numbers is 13.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13. But let me confirm with the example. The sum of 1 to 13 is 91. Then, we need 9 more. So replacing the last number (13) with 13 +9=22. So the numbers are 1,2,...,12,22. All distinct, sum is 91 -13 +22 = 100. So that works. Therefore, 13 numbers.\n\nAlternatively, could we have another combination with 13 numbers? For example, instead of replacing 13 with 22, maybe replace some other numbers. But regardless, the count is 13. So the maximum is 13.\n\nBut wait, another thought: what if we don't take the consecutive numbers but take some numbers with gaps, allowing us to have more numbers? For example, if we take numbers starting from 1 but skip some numbers to make room for others. But how?\n\nWait, for example, if we take numbers 1,2,3,...,k, and then some other numbers. But the problem is that the minimal sum for 13 numbers is 91, and we need to reach 100. If we take numbers that are not consecutive, but have some larger numbers, but that would make the sum larger. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take numbers that are not starting from 1. For example, if we skip 1 and take 2,3,...,n. But that would make the sum larger, so even worse. Therefore, the minimal sum is achieved by starting from 1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the maximum number is 13. Hence, the answer is 13.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the **maximum number of distinct natural numbers** that sum to **100**, we must consider the following:\n\n### Key Insight:\nTo **maximize the count** of distinct numbers, we should use the **smallest possible natural numbers** (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ..., n). This is because smaller numbers contribute less to the total sum, allowing us to include more terms before exceeding 100.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find the Largest $ n $ Such That $ 1 + 2 + \\dots + n \\leq 100 $\n\nThe sum of the first $ n $ natural numbers is given by the formula:\n$$\nS = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\nWe solve for the largest $ n $ such that:\n$$\n\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\leq 100\n$$\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n$$\nn(n+1) \\leq 200\n$$\nSolving the quadratic inequality:\n$$\nn^2 + n - 200 \\leq 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 800}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{801}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{801} \\approx 28.3 \\Rightarrow n \\approx \\frac{-1 + 28.3}{2} \\approx 13.65\n$$\nThus, the largest integer $ n $ is **13**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Sum for $ n = 13 $\n\n$$\n\\frac{13 \\cdot 14}{2} = 91\n$$\nThis is **9 less than 100**. To adjust the sum to 100, we can **replace the largest number (13)** with a larger number:\n$$\n13 + 9 = 22\n$$\nNow the numbers are: $ 1, 2, 3, \\dots, 12, 22 $, which are all **distinct** and sum to:\n$$\n91 - 13 + 22 = 100\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Can We Use More Than 13 Numbers?\n\nFor $ n = 14 $, the minimal sum is:\n$$\n\\frac{14 \\cdot 15}{2} = 105 > 100\n$$\nThis exceeds 100, so it is **impossible** to use 14 distinct natural numbers to sum to 100.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{13}\n$$",
