    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So there's this problem about two trains. The first one leaves a station going north at 75 mph. Then three hours later, another train leaves the same station going the same direction but faster, at 90 mph. The question is, how long will it take for the second train to catch up to the first one?\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the time it takes for the second train to catch up. Let me think. When the second train starts, the first one has already been traveling for three hours. So by the time the second train departs, the first train is already some distance ahead. That distance would be speed multiplied by time, right? So 75 mph times 3 hours. Let me calculate that: 75 * 3 = 225 miles. So the first train is 225 miles ahead when the second train starts.\n\nNow, the second train is going faster, 90 mph compared to the first's 75 mph. So the relative speed between the two trains is the difference in their speeds. That would be 90 - 75 = 15 mph. So the second train is gaining on the first one at 15 miles per hour. \n\nTo catch up, the second train needs to cover that 225-mile gap at a rate of 15 mph. Time is distance divided by speed, so 225 miles divided by 15 mph. Let me do that division: 225 / 15 = 15. So that would take 15 hours. \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. If the second train is going 15 mph faster, then every hour it closes the gap by 15 miles. So after 1 hour, the gap is 210 miles, after 2 hours, 195, and so on. After 15 hours, the gap would be 225 - (15*15) = 225 - 225 = 0. Yeah, that checks out. So the answer should be 15 hours.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is to set up equations for the distance each train has traveled. Let me try that approach to confirm. Let t be the time the second train has been traveling when it catches up. Then the first train has been traveling for t + 3 hours. The distance each has traveled should be equal when they meet.\n\nSo, distance for first train: 75*(t + 3)\nDistance for second train: 90*t\nSet them equal: 75(t + 3) = 90t\nExpanding: 75t + 225 = 90t\nSubtract 75t: 225 = 15t\nDivide by 15: t = 15. Yep, same answer. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the second train will catch up after 15 hours of its own travel time. So the answer is 15 hours. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. The first train's head start was 3 hours, so 75*3=225. The relative speed is 15 mph, so 225/15=15. Both methods give the same result. Seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe second train will take **15 hours** to catch up to the first train. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Head Start Distance**:  \n   The first train travels for 3 hours before the second train departs:  \n   $ 75 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 225 \\, \\text{miles} $.\n\n2. **Relative Speed**:  \n   The second train closes the gap at a rate of:  \n   $ 90 \\, \\text{mph} - 75 \\, \\text{mph} = 15 \\, \\text{mph} $.\n\n3. **Time to Catch Up**:  \n   Time = Distance / Relative Speed:  \n   $ \\frac{225 \\, \\text{miles}}{15 \\, \\text{mph}} = 15 \\, \\text{hours} $.\n\n**Verification via Equations**:  \nLet $ t $ be the time the second train travels. The first train travels $ t + 3 $ hours. Setting distances equal:  \n$ 75(t + 3) = 90t $  \nSolving:  \n$ 75t + 225 = 90t $  \n$ 225 = 15t $  \n$ t = 15 \\, \\text{hours} $.\n\n**Answer**: 15 hours.",
