    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the maximum number of peaches someone can eat with 10 cents, considering that you can exchange 3 peach pits for another peach. Hmm, so first, I need to break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with 10 cents, each peach costs 1 cent, so initially, you can buy 10 peaches. But then, after eating those peaches, you'll have 10 pits. Now, the key part is exchanging those pits for more peaches. Since 3 pits can be exchanged for 1 peach, I need to figure out how many times I can do this exchange.\n\nSo, first purchase: 10 peaches, 10 cents spent, 10 pits obtained. Then, exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. That would give me 10 / 3 = 3 peaches with 1 pit left over. Wait, 3 times 3 is 9, so 3 exchanges would use 9 pits, leaving 1 pit. So after the first exchange, I get 3 more peaches, and now I have 1 pit from the initial 10, plus the 3 new pits from eating those 3 peaches. Wait, no, when you eat a peach, you get a pit. So each time you eat a peach, you get a pit. So after the first 10 peaches, you have 10 pits. Then you exchange 9 of them for 3 peaches, which you eat, giving you 3 more pits. So total pits after that would be 1 (leftover from initial 10) + 3 (from the 3 new peaches) = 4 pits.\n\nNow, with 4 pits, you can exchange 3 of them for another peach. So that's 1 more peach, which you eat, giving you another pit. Now you have 1 pit left from the previous 4 (since you used 3) plus 1 new pit from the eaten peach, totaling 2 pits. \n\nSo now, you have 2 pits. Not enough to exchange for another peach. So total peaches eaten so far: 10 (initial) + 3 (first exchange) + 1 (second exchange) = 14. But wait, is there a way to get more?\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. Let's track each step carefully.\n\nStart with 10 cents. Buy 10 peaches. Eat them, get 10 pits. Now, exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. So 10 pits / 3 = 3 peaches with 1 pit remaining. So after exchange, you have 3 peaches. Eat them, get 3 pits. Now total pits: 1 (from initial) + 3 (from new peaches) = 4. Then exchange 3 of those 4 for another peach. Eat it, get 1 pit. Now total pits: 1 (from previous 4) + 1 (from new peach) = 2. Can't exchange anymore. So total peaches: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to borrow a pit or something? No, the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe 14 is the answer. But I've heard similar problems where the answer is higher. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the second exchange, you have 2 pits. But if you can somehow get another pit from somewhere else. Wait, no. Unless there's a way to do more exchanges. Let me check the math again.\n\nFirst purchase: 10 peaches, 10 cents. Pits: 10.\n\nExchange 3 pits for 1 peach: 10 / 3 = 3 peaches, 1 pit left. So 3 peaches eaten, 3 pits added. Total pits: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nExchange 3 pits for 1 peach: 4 / 3 = 1 peach, 1 pit left. Eat that peach, get 1 pit. Total pits: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNo more exchanges. So total peaches: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe after the first exchange, you have 3 peaches, which you eat, giving 3 pits. Then you have 1 (from initial) + 3 = 4 pits. Then exchange 3 for 1 peach, eat it, get 1 pit. Now you have 1 + 1 = 2 pits. Then, if you can borrow a pit, but that's not allowed. So 14 is the total.\n\nBut I remember a similar problem where the answer was 15. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the exchange steps.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Each time you have pits, you can exchange them for more peaches, which in turn give more pits. So maybe there's a way to do more exchanges.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's track the number of peaches and pits step by step.\n\nStart with 10 cents. Buy 10 peaches. Eat them, so 10 peaches eaten, 10 pits.\n\nNow, exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. So 10 pits can be exchanged for 3 peaches (using 9 pits), leaving 1 pit. Eat those 3 peaches, so 3 more peaches eaten, and 3 pits added. Now total pits: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nExchange 3 pits for 1 peach. Now, 4 pits can be exchanged for 1 peach (using 3 pits), leaving 1 pit. Eat that peach, so 1 more peach eaten, and 1 pit added. Now total pits: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNo more exchanges. Total peaches: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\nHmm. But maybe there's a way to do more. Wait, if after getting 2 pits, you can't exchange. But what if you had a way to get more pits? No, unless you can do something else. Wait, maybe I missed that when you exchange 3 pits for a peach, you can then eat it and get a pit. So maybe there's a cycle here.\n\nWait, let's think of it as a loop. Each time you have pits, you exchange as many as possible for peaches, eat them, and get more pits. So:\n\nInitial: 10 cents → 10 peaches, 10 pits.\n\nExchange 10 pits: 10 / 3 = 3 peaches (using 9 pits), 1 pit left. Eat 3 peaches → 3 pits. Total pits: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nExchange 4 pits: 4 / 3 = 1 peach (using 3 pits), 1 pit left. Eat 1 peach → 1 pit. Total pits: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nExchange 2 pits: can't do anything. Total peaches: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to manage the pits. For example, if you save some pits to combine with future ones. But in this case, after the first exchange, you have 1 pit left. Then after getting 3 more, you have 4. Then exchange 3, get 1, and have 2. No, same result.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to do more exchanges if you consider that when you get the 1 peach from the 4 pits, you eat it and get a pit, so you have 2 pits. Then, if you could somehow get another pit from somewhere else. But you can't. So 14 seems right.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because I remember similar problems where the answer is higher. Let me check with a smaller amount. For example, if you have 3 cents, you can buy 3 peaches, eat them, get 3 pits, exchange for 1 peach, eat it, get 1 pit. Total peaches: 3 + 1 = 4. So with 3 cents, you get 4 peaches. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, with 4 cents: buy 4 peaches, eat them, 4 pits. Exchange 3 for 1 peach, eat it, get 1 pit. Now you have 1 (from initial 4-3=1) +1=2 pits. Can't exchange. Total: 4 +1=5.\n\nWait, but if you have 4 cents, you can get 5 peaches. So the formula seems to be that each time you can get more by exchanging pits. So with 10 cents, following the same logic, 14 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mathematical formula here. Let me think. The total number of peaches is equal to the initial number plus the number of exchanges possible. But each exchange requires 3 pits, and each peach gives 1 pit. So it's like a system where you can keep exchanging as long as you have enough pits.\n\nThis is similar to the classic water jug problem or the coin exchange problem. The formula for the maximum number of peaches would be the initial number plus the floor of (initial number / (3-1)) or something like that. Wait, maybe not. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet me denote the total number of peaches as T. Each time you have some pits, you can exchange them for peaches. The process is:\n\nStart with C cents. Buy C peaches, eat them, get C pits.\n\nThen, while you have at least 3 pits:\n\nExchange 3 pits for 1 peach, eat it, get 1 pit.\n\nSo each exchange reduces the number of pits by 2 (since you give 3 and get 1 back). So the number of exchanges possible is floor(pits / 3) each time, but since after each exchange, you get more pits.\n\nWait, this is similar to the problem where you have a certain number of coins and can exchange them for more coins. The total number of peaches would be the initial number plus the number of times you can exchange the pits.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nLet me think of it as a loop:\n\nStart with 10 cents → 10 peaches, 10 pits.\n\nLoop:\n\nWhile pits >= 3:\n\n   exchange 3 pits for 1 peach.\n\n   eat the peach, so add 1 pit.\n\nSo, the number of times you can do this is equal to the number of times you can subtract 3 and add 1, which is equivalent to subtracting 2 each time.\n\nBut how many times can you do this with 10 pits?\n\nFirst iteration: 10 pits → exchange 3, get 1 peach, now pits = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8.\n\nSecond iteration: 8 pits → exchange 3, get 1 peach, pits = 8 -3 +1 = 6.\n\nThird: 6 → 6-3+1=4.\n\nFourth: 4 → 4-3+1=2.\n\nFifth: 2 <3, stop.\n\nSo total exchanges: 4 times. So total peaches: 10 + 4 = 14. Which matches the earlier count.\n\nSo that seems to confirm it's 14.\n\nBut wait, in the first iteration, when you have 10 pits, you exchange 3, get 1 peach. Then you have 10-3=7 pits, plus 1 from the eaten peach, total 8. Then exchange 3 again, 8-3=5 +1=6. Then 6-3=3 +1=4. Then 4-3=1 +1=2. So four exchanges. So 10 +4=14.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 14.\n\nBut I want to make sure there's no other way. For example, if you could do something like saving some pits to combine with future ones. But in this case, the process is linear. Each exchange reduces the number of pits by 2, so starting from 10, you can do 4 exchanges (each time subtracting 2: 10,8,6,4,2). So 4 exchanges. Hence 14.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of peaches is 14.\n</think>\n\nThe maximal number of peaches you can eat with 10 cents is **14**. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Purchase**:  \n   - Spend 10 cents to buy **10 peaches**.  \n   - After eating them, you have **10 pits**.\n\n2. **First Exchange**:  \n   - Exchange **3 pits** for **1 peach** (using 9 pits, leaving 1 pit).  \n   - Eat the peach, gaining **1 pit**.  \n   - Total pits now: **1 (leftover) + 1 (from new peach) = 2 pits**.  \n   - Total peaches eaten: **10 + 1 = 11**.\n\n3. **Second Exchange**:  \n   - Exchange **3 pits** for **1 peach** (using 3 pits, leaving 0 pits).  \n   - Eat the peach, gaining **1 pit**.  \n   - Total pits now: **1 (from new peach)**.  \n   - Total peaches eaten: **11 + 1 = 12**.\n\n4. **Third Exchange**:  \n   - Exchange **3 pits** for **1 peach** (but you only have 1 pit, so this is not possible).  \n   - No further exchanges can be made.  \n\nWait—this seems inconsistent with the earlier calculation. Let me correct this with a more systematic approach:\n\n### Corrected Step-by-Step:\n- **Start with 10 cents**: Buy **10 peaches**, eat them, and collect **10 pits**.  \n- **Exchange 3 pits for 1 peach**:  \n  - Use 9 pits to get **3 peaches** (leaving 1 pit).  \n  - Eat the 3 peaches, gaining **3 pits**.  \n  - Total pits: **1 (leftover) + 3 = 4**.  \n  - Total peaches eaten: **10 + 3 = 13**.  \n\n- **Exchange 3 pits for 1 peach**:  \n  - Use 3 pits to get **1 peach** (leaving 1 pit).  \n  - Eat the peach, gaining **1 pit**.  \n  - Total pits: **1 (leftover) + 1 = 2**.  \n  - Total peaches eaten: **13 + 1 = 14**.  \n\n- **No further exchanges** (only 2 pits remain).  \n\n### Final Answer:  \n**14 peaches**.  \n\nThis result is derived by iteratively exchanging pits for peaches until no more exchanges are possible, ensuring all available pits are used optimally.",
