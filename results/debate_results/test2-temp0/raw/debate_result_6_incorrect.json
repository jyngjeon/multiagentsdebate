    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about apples that lose water over time, changing their water content percentage. The initial weight is 1 ton, which is 90% water. After some days, the water content drops to 80%, and we need to find the new weight.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that when the water content changes, the non-water part (the dry mass) remains the same, right? Because the apples are just losing water, not the actual fruit matter. So the dry mass is constant, and the water percentage is changing, which affects the total weight.\n\nSo, initially, the apples are 90% water. That means 10% is dry matter. Let me calculate the dry matter first. If the total weight is 1 ton, which is 1000 kg, then 10% of that is dry matter. 10% of 1000 kg is 100 kg. So the dry mass is 100 kg.\n\nAfter some time, the water content is 80%, so the dry matter is now 20% of the total weight. Wait, because if water is 80%, then the rest (100% - 80% = 20%) is dry matter. Since the dry matter hasn't changed, it's still 100 kg. So if 20% of the new total weight is 100 kg, then the total weight can be calculated by dividing 100 kg by 20% (which is 0.2). So 100 / 0.2 = 500 kg. Therefore, the new weight is 500 kg.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the percentages. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nOriginal weight: 1000 kg. 90% water, so 900 kg water and 100 kg dry matter. After drying, the water is 80%, so the dry matter is 20% of the new weight. Since dry matter is still 100 kg, then 20% of the new weight equals 100 kg. So new weight = 100 kg / 0.2 = 500 kg. That seems right.\n\nBut sometimes people get confused here. For example, if you think that the water loss is 10%, but that's not the case. The percentage is of the total weight, not the water loss. So the key is that the dry mass remains the same, and the percentage of dry mass increases as the water decreases. So the total weight must decrease.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let’s denote the new total weight as x. The dry matter is still 100 kg, which is 20% of x. So 0.2x = 100 kg. Solving for x gives x = 500 kg. That seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But maybe I should check with another method. Suppose the apples lose water until the water is 80%. Let’s say the amount of water lost is y kg. Then, the new water content is 900 kg - y kg, and the total weight is 1000 kg - y kg. The new water percentage is (900 - y) / (1000 - y) = 80% = 0.8. Let's solve this equation.\n\n(900 - y) / (1000 - y) = 0.8\n\nMultiply both sides by (1000 - y):\n\n900 - y = 0.8*(1000 - y)\n\nCalculate the right side: 0.8*1000 - 0.8y = 800 - 0.8y\n\nSo:\n\n900 - y = 800 - 0.8y\n\nBring variables to one side and constants to the other:\n\n900 - 800 = y - 0.8y\n\n100 = 0.2y\n\nTherefore, y = 100 / 0.2 = 500 kg\n\nSo the water lost is 500 kg, and the new total weight is 1000 - 500 = 500 kg. That matches the previous result. So that's another way to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 500 kg. But I need to make sure that the initial assumption that the dry mass remains the same is correct. Yes, because the problem states that the apples lose water, not that they lose mass through other means. So the dry mass is constant. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of the apples after the water content decreases to 80% is **500 kg**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Composition**:  \n   - Total weight = 1 ton = 1000 kg.  \n   - Water = 90% of 1000 kg = **900 kg**.  \n   - Dry matter = 10% of 1000 kg = **100 kg**.  \n\n2. **After Drying**:  \n   - The dry matter remains **100 kg** (no loss of non-water content).  \n   - The new water content is 80%, so the dry matter now constitutes **20%** of the total weight.  \n\n3. **Calculate New Total Weight**:  \n   Let the new total weight be $ x $.  \n   Since 20% of $ x $ = 100 kg:  \n   $$\n   0.2x = 100 \\implies x = \\frac{100}{0.2} = 500 \\, \\text{kg}.\n   $$\n\n**Conclusion**: The apples now weigh **500 kg**. The key insight is that the dry mass remains constant, and the reduction in water content (from 90% to 80%) causes the total weight to decrease significantly.",
