    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best strategy to maximize the probability of selecting the best candidate out of 100, given that they come in a random order and I can only decide to accept or reject each one as they come, with no going back. Hmm, I remember something about the \"secretary problem\" from probability. Let me think.\n\nThe problem is classic, right? The idea is that you can't go back once you've rejected someone, so you need a strategy that balances between looking at enough candidates to get a sense of the quality and then picking the first one that's better than all the previous ones. But how exactly does that work?\n\nI think the optimal strategy is to reject the first n/e candidates (where e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.718) and then pick the first candidate that's better than all those initial ones. For 100 candidates, n is 100, so n/e is about 37. So you reject the first 37 candidates, and then choose the next one that's better than all of them. That gives a probability of about 1/e, which is roughly 36.8%. But wait, is that exactly the case?\n\nWait, maybe the exact number isn't exactly n/e, but the closest integer. For 100, 100 divided by e is approximately 36.78, so you'd take the first 36 or 37 candidates as the sample, then pick the next best one. But I need to confirm the exact strategy and the probability.\n\nLet me try to recall the derivation. The idea is that you want to maximize the probability that the best candidate is in the second part of the sequence, after the initial sample. If you set a cutoff of k, then the probability that the best candidate is after the first k is (100 - k)/100. Then, given that the best candidate is after the first k, the probability that the first candidate after the cutoff is the best one is 1/(100 - k). So the total probability is the sum over k from 1 to 100 of [probability that the best is in the second part] times [probability that the first candidate in the second part is the best]. Wait, maybe that's not exactly right.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal strategy is to choose a cutoff k, and then accept the first candidate after the cutoff who is better than all the first k candidates. The probability of success is then the sum from i=k+1 to 100 of [probability that the best candidate is at position i and that all candidates before i are worse than the best candidate]. But since the best candidate is equally likely to be in any position, the probability that the best is at position i is 1/100. Then, given that the best is at position i, the probability that all previous candidates (positions 1 to i-1) are worse than the best is 1/(i-1) because the best candidate is equally likely to be in any position, so the probability that the best is in position i and all previous are worse is 1/100 * 1/(i-1). Wait, no, that might not be the right way to think about it.\n\nActually, if the best candidate is at position i, then the probability that the first candidate after the cutoff (which is k) that is better than all previous is the best candidate. So if the cutoff is k, then for the best candidate to be selected, they must be in the second part (positions k+1 to 100), and they must be the first one in that part that is better than all the first k candidates. Since the best candidate is in the second part, the probability that they are the first one in the second part that is better than all the first k is 1/(number of candidates in the second part). Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we set the cutoff at k. Then, for each position i from k+1 to 100, the probability that the best candidate is at position i and that all candidates before i (positions 1 to i-1) are worse than the candidate at i. But since the best candidate is at i, the candidates before i are all worse. However, the strategy is to accept the first candidate after the cutoff that is better than all the first k. So if the best candidate is in the second part (positions k+1 to 100), then the probability that the first candidate in the second part that is better than all the first k is the best candidate. But the best candidate is in the second part, so the probability that the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate is 1/(number of candidates in the second part). Wait, no, that's not correct either.\n\nActually, if the best candidate is in the second part, then the probability that the first candidate in the second part that is better than all the first k is the best candidate. Since the best candidate is in the second part, the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. But since the best candidate is the best overall, any candidate in the second part that is better than the first k must be the best candidate. Wait, no. If the best candidate is in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k could be someone else, but not the best. However, if the best candidate is in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. But since the best candidate is the best, if they are in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. However, the best candidate could be anywhere in the second part. So the probability that the best candidate is selected is the probability that the best candidate is in the second part and that they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. Since the best candidate is equally likely to be in any position, the probability that they are in the second part is (100 - k)/100. Given that, the probability that they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is 1/(number of candidates in the second part). Wait, no, that's not right. If the best candidate is in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. However, the first k candidates are fixed, and the best candidate is in the second part. The first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. But since the best candidate is the best, if they are in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. However, the first k candidates are all worse than the best candidate, so the best candidate is better than all of them. Therefore, if the best candidate is in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. But the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k could be any candidate in the second part that is better than the first k. However, since the best candidate is in the second part, the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The probability that the best candidate is selected using the cutoff strategy is the sum over all positions i from k+1 to 100 of the probability that the best candidate is at position i and that all candidates before i (positions 1 to i-1) are worse than the candidate at i. But since the best candidate is at i, the candidates before i are all worse. However, the strategy is to accept the first candidate after the cutoff (k) that is better than all the first k. So if the best candidate is at position i, then the strategy will accept them if and only if they are the first candidate after the cutoff that is better than all the first k. But since the best candidate is better than all the first k, if they are in the second part (i > k), then the strategy will accept them if they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. However, if there is a candidate in the second part before the best candidate that is better than the first k, then the strategy would have accepted that candidate instead. Therefore, the probability that the best candidate is selected is the probability that the best candidate is in the second part and that there is no candidate in the second part before the best candidate that is better than the first k. Since the first k candidates are fixed, the probability that the best candidate is in the second part and that all candidates in the second part before the best candidate are not better than the first k. Wait, but the first k candidates are the ones we've already seen, so the candidates in the second part (positions k+1 to 100) are compared to the first k. So if the best candidate is in the second part, then the probability that they are selected is the probability that they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. Since the first k candidates are fixed, the first k candidates have some maximum value. The best candidate is in the second part, so the probability that they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is 1/(number of candidates in the second part). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The number of candidates in the second part is 100 - k. The best candidate is equally likely to be in any of the positions from 1 to 100. If the best candidate is in the second part, then the probability that they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is 1/(number of candidates in the second part). Wait, that seems too simplistic. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the best candidate is in the second part. Then, the first k candidates are all worse than the best candidate. The candidates in the second part (positions k+1 to 100) are a random permutation of the remaining 99 candidates, with the best candidate being one of them. The probability that the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is the same as the probability that the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. Since the first k candidates are fixed, the first k candidates have a certain maximum value. The candidates in the second part are compared to this maximum. The best candidate is in the second part, so the probability that they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is 1/(number of candidates in the second part). Wait, that might be the case. Because if the best candidate is in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is equally likely to be any of the candidates in the second part. Since the best candidate is the best, if they are in the second part, then the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first k is the best candidate if and only if the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k. Since the candidates in the second part are randomly ordered, the probability that the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is 1/(number of candidates in the second part). Therefore, the total probability is (number of candidates in the second part)/100 * 1/(number of candidates in the second part) = 1/100. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the probability is 1/100 regardless of k, which is not correct.\n\nHmm, clearly I'm making a mistake here. Let me look up the formula again. The probability of success with cutoff k is the sum from i=k+1 to n of [probability that the best candidate is at position i] * [probability that the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k]. Since the best candidate is at position i, the probability that they are the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is 1/(i - k). Wait, no. If the best candidate is at position i, then the first k candidates are positions 1 to k, and the second part is positions k+1 to 100. The probability that the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first k is the probability that all candidates in positions k+1 to i-1 are not better than the first k. Since the best candidate is at i, the candidates in positions k+1 to i-1 are all worse than the best candidate, but they might be better than the first k. Wait, but the first k candidates have a maximum value. The candidates in positions k+1 to i-1 are compared to that maximum. The probability that none of them are better than the first k is the probability that the maximum of the first k is greater than all of the candidates in positions k+1 to i-1. But since the candidates are randomly ordered, the probability that the maximum of the first k is greater than the maximum of the next (i - k - 1) candidates is equal to the probability that the maximum of the first k is the maximum of the first i - 1 candidates. Since all permutations are equally likely, the probability that the maximum of the first i - 1 candidates is in the first k is k/(i - 1). Therefore, the probability that the maximum of the first i - 1 is in the first k is k/(i - 1), which means the probability that the maximum of the first i - 1 is not in the first k (i.e., the maximum of the first i - 1 is in positions k+1 to i - 1) is 1 - k/(i - 1). Therefore, the probability that the best candidate is selected when they are at position i is the probability that the maximum of the first i - 1 is in the first k, which is k/(i - 1). Wait, no. If the best candidate is at position i, then the maximum of the first i - 1 is not the best candidate, so the maximum of the first i - 1 is the maximum of the first i - 1 candidates. For the strategy to select the best candidate at position i, it must be that the first candidate in the second part (positions k+1 to 100) that is better than the first k is the best candidate. That would happen if all candidates in positions k+1 to i - 1 are not better than the first k. Which is equivalent to the maximum of the first i - 1 candidates being in the first k. Therefore, the probability that the best candidate is selected when they are at position i is the probability that the maximum of the first i - 1 is in the first k, which is k/(i - 1). Therefore, the total probability of success is the sum from i=k+1 to 100 of [probability that the best is at i] * [probability that the maximum of first i - 1 is in first k] = sum_{i=k+1}^{100} [1/100 * k/(i - 1)].\n\nSo the total probability is (k/100) * sum_{i=k+1}^{100} 1/(i - 1) = (k/100) * sum_{j=k}^{99} 1/j. Wait, because when i goes from k+1 to 100, j = i - 1 goes from k to 99. Therefore, the probability is (k/100) * [H_{99} - H_{k-1}], where H_n is the nth harmonic number.\n\nTo find the optimal k, we need to maximize this expression. For large n, the harmonic numbers can be approximated by ln(n) + γ, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (~0.5772). Therefore, the probability is approximately (k/n) * [ln(n) - ln(k) + γ - γ] = (k/n) * ln(n/k). To maximize this, take derivative with respect to k and set to zero. Let me consider the continuous approximation where k is a real number. Let f(k) = (k/n) * ln(n/k). Taking derivative with respect to k:\n\nf'(k) = (1/n) * ln(n/k) + (k/n) * (-1/k) = (1/n) [ln(n/k) - 1]. Setting to zero:\n\nln(n/k) - 1 = 0 => ln(n/k) = 1 => n/k = e => k = n/e.\n\nTherefore, the optimal k is approximately n/e, which for n=100 is about 36.78, so k=37. Then the probability is approximately 1/e ≈ 36.8%.\n\nBut for exact calculation with n=100, we need to compute the exact value. The exact probability when k=37 is (37/100) * [H_{99} - H_{36}]. The harmonic numbers H_n can be calculated as H_n = γ + ln(n) + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + ... but for exact values, we need to compute them numerically.\n\nAlternatively, using the approximation H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2). So H_{99} ≈ ln(99) + γ + 1/(2*99) - 1/(12*99^2), and H_{36} ≈ ln(36) + γ + 1/(2*36) - 1/(12*36^2). Then H_{99} - H_{36} ≈ ln(99/36) + [1/(2*99) - 1/(2*36)] - [1/(12*99^2) - 1/(12*36^2)]. But this might be too complicated. Alternatively, using the approximate value of H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n). Then H_{99} - H_{36} ≈ ln(99) - ln(36) + [1/(2*99) - 1/(2*36)] ≈ ln(99/36) + (1/198 - 1/72). Let's compute that:\n\nln(99/36) = ln(11/4) ≈ ln(2.75) ≈ 1.013.\n\nThen 1/198 ≈ 0.00505, 1/72 ≈ 0.01389. So 0.00505 - 0.01389 ≈ -0.00884. So total is approximately 1.013 - 0.00884 ≈ 1.004. Then the probability is (37/100) * 1.004 ≈ 0.37 * 1.004 ≈ 0.3715, which is about 37.15%, which is close to 1/e ≈ 0.3679 or 36.79%. So the approximation holds.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to reject the first 37 candidates (approximately n/e) and then select the first candidate after that who is better than all the first 37. The probability of success is approximately 1/e, about 36.8%.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check for n=100, the exact value. The exact probability when k=37 is (37/100) * [H_{99} - H_{36}]. Let me compute H_{99} and H_{36} numerically.\n\nH_n can be calculated as the sum from m=1 to n of 1/m. For H_{36}:\n\nH_36 ≈ 3.99499 (I remember that H_10 ≈ 2.928968, H_20 ≈ 3.59774, H_30 ≈ 3.99499, H_40 ≈ 4.27854, H_50 ≈ 4.49921, H_100 ≈ 5.18738). Wait, but H_36 is between H_30 and H_40. Let me check exact values.\n\nAlternatively, using an online calculator or known values. For example, H_36 is approximately 3.99499, H_99 is approximately 5.1773775. Then H_99 - H_36 ≈ 5.1773775 - 3.99499 ≈ 1.1823875. Then the probability is (37/100) * 1.1823875 ≈ 0.37 * 1.1823875 ≈ 0.4375, which is about 43.75%? Wait, that can't be right because earlier approximation suggested around 37%. There's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe my H_99 and H_36 values are incorrect.\n\nWait, H_100 is approximately 5.18738, so H_99 is H_100 - 1/100 ≈ 5.18738 - 0.01 = 5.17738. H_36 is approximately 3.99499. Then H_99 - H_36 ≈ 5.17738 - 3.99499 ≈ 1.18239. Then multiplying by 37/100 gives 1.18239 * 0.37 ≈ 0.4375, which is about 43.75%. But that contradicts the earlier approximation of 1/e ≈ 36.8%. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, no, the formula I derived earlier was (k/n) * [H_{n-1} - H_{k-1}]. Wait, for n=100, the probability is (k/100) * [H_{99} - H_{k-1}]. If k=37, then it's (37/100) * [H_{99} - H_{36}]. But if H_{99} - H_{36} ≈ 1.182, then 37/100 * 1.182 ≈ 0.437, which is about 43.7%. But that's way higher than 1/e. So clearly, there's a mistake in my derivation.\n\nWait, let me go back. Earlier, I thought the probability was sum_{i=k+1}^{n} [1/n * k/(i-1)]. But that seems to be incorrect. Let me re-derive it properly.\n\nThe probability that the best candidate is selected is the sum over all positions i from k+1 to n of the probability that the best candidate is at position i and that all candidates before i (positions 1 to i-1) are worse than the candidate at i. But since the best candidate is at i, the candidates before i are all worse. However, the strategy is to accept the first candidate after the cutoff (k) that is better than all the first k. So if the best candidate is at position i, then the strategy will accept them if and only if they are the first candidate in the second part (positions k+1 to n) that is better than all the first k. For this to happen, all candidates in positions k+1 to i-1 must not be better than the first k. Which is equivalent to the maximum of the first i-1 candidates being in the first k. The probability that the maximum of the first i-1 candidates is in the first k is k/(i-1). Therefore, the probability that the best candidate is selected when they are at position i is [probability that best is at i] * [probability that max of first i-1 is in first k] = (1/n) * (k/(i-1)). Therefore, the total probability is sum_{i=k+1}^n [1/n * k/(i-1)] = (k/n) * sum_{i=k+1}^n 1/(i-1) = (k/n) * sum_{j=k}^{n-1} 1/j = (k/n) * [H_{n-1} - H_{k-1}].\n\nSo for n=100 and k=37, it's (37/100) * [H_{99} - H_{36}]. If H_{99} ≈ 5.177 and H_{36} ≈ 3.995, then the difference is about 1.182, and multiplying by 37/100 gives ≈ 0.437, which is 43.7%. But this contradicts the earlier approximation of 1/e ≈ 36.8%. What's the error here?\n\nWait, maybe my H_n values are wrong. Let me check H_36 and H_99 more accurately.\n\nH_36 is the 36th harmonic number. Let me calculate it step by step:\n\nH_1 = 1\n\nH_2 = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5\n\nH_3 = 1.5 + 1/3 ≈ 1.8333\n\nH_4 ≈ 1.8333 + 0.25 = 2.0833\n\nH_5 ≈ 2.0833 + 0.2 = 2.2833\n\nH_6 ≈ 2.2833 + 0.1667 ≈ 2.45\n\nH_7 ≈ 2.45 + 0.1429 ≈ 2.5929\n\nH_8 ≈ 2.5929 + 0.125 ≈ 2.7179\n\nH_9 ≈ 2.7179 + 0.1111 ≈ 2.829\n\nH_10 ≈ 2.829 + 0.1 = 2.929\n\nH_11 ≈ 2.929 + 0.0909 ≈ 3.0199\n\nH_12 ≈ 3.0199 + 0.0833 ≈ 3.1032\n\nH_13 ≈ 3.1032 + 0.0769 ≈ 3.1801\n\nH_14 ≈ 3.1801 + 0.0714 ≈ 3.2515\n\nH_15 ≈ 3.2515 + 0.0667 ≈ 3.3182\n\nH_16 ≈ 3.3182 + 0.0625 ≈ 3.3807\n\nH_17 ≈ 3.3807 + 0.0588 ≈ 3.4395\n\nH_18 ≈ 3.4395 + 0.0556 ≈ 3.4951\n\nH_19 ≈ 3.4951 + 0.0526 ≈ 3.5477\n\nH_20 ≈ 3.5477 + 0.05 = 3.5977\n\nH_21 ≈ 3.5977 + 0.0476 ≈ 3.6453\n\nH_22 ≈ 3.6453 + 0.0455 ≈ 3.6908\n\nH_23 ≈ 3.6908 + 0.0435 ≈ 3.7343\n\nH_24 ≈ 3.7343 + 0.0417 ≈ 3.776\n\nH_25 ≈ 3.776 + 0.04 = 3.816\n\nH_26 ≈ 3.816 + 0.0385 ≈ 3.8545\n\nH_27 ≈ 3.8545 + 0.037 ≈ 3.8915\n\nH_28 ≈ 3.8915 + 0.0357 ≈ 3.9272\n\nH_29 ≈ 3.9272 + 0.0345 ≈ 3.9617\n\nH_30 ≈ 3.9617 + 0.0333 ≈ 3.995\n\nH_31 ≈ 3.995 + 0.0323 ≈ 4.0273\n\nH_32 ≈ 4.0273 + 0.03125 ≈ 4.0585\n\nH_33 ≈ 4.0585 + 0.0303 ≈ 4.0888\n\nH_34 ≈ 4.0888 + 0.0294 ≈ 4.1182\n\nH_35 ≈ 4.1182 + 0.0286 ≈ 4.1468\n\nH_36 ≈ 4.1468 + 0.0278 ≈ 4.1746\n\nSo H_36 ≈ 4.1746. Earlier I thought it was 3.99499, which was incorrect. That was my mistake. So H_36 is approximately 4.1746. Then H_99 is approximately 5.17738 (as before). So H_99 - H_36 ≈ 5.17738 - 4.1746 ≈ 1.00278. Then the probability is (37/100) * 1.00278 ≈ 0.37 * 1.00278 ≈ 0.371, which is about 37.1%, which is close to 1/e ≈ 36.8%. That makes sense now. So the earlier error was due to incorrect H_36 value.\n\nTherefore, the exact probability when k=37 is approximately 37.1%, which is close to 1/e. For n=100, the optimal k is 37, and the probability is approximately 37%, which is about 1/e.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to reject the first 37 candidates and then accept the first candidate who is better than all the first 37. The probability of success is approximately 37%, which is 1/e.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check for k=37, the exact value. If H_99 - H_36 ≈ 1.00278, then 37 * 1.00278 / 100 ≈ 37.10286 / 100 ≈ 0.371, which is 37.1%. For k=36, let's compute it. H_35 ≈ 4.1468, so H_99 - H_35 ≈ 5.17738 - 4.1468 ≈ 1.03058. Then (36/100) * 1.03058 ≈ 0.36 * 1.03058 ≈ 0.371, same as before. Wait, so both k=36 and k=37 give similar probabilities? Let me check with k=36:\n\nH_99 - H_35 ≈ 5.17738 - 4.1468 ≈ 1.03058. Then 36/100 * 1.03058 ≈ 0.36 * 1.03058 ≈ 0.371. Similarly for k=37, it's 0.37 * 1.00278 ≈ 0.371. So both k=36 and k=37 give about the same probability. Hence, the optimal k is around 37, and the probability is approximately 37%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the optimal strategy is to reject the first n/e candidates (approximately 37 for n=100) and then select the first candidate who is better than all the first n/e candidates. The probability of success is approximately 1/e, about 36.8%.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal strategy for maximizing the probability of selecting the best candidate from 100 in a random order is known as the **\"secretary problem\"** solution. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Strategy:**\n1. **Reject the first $ k $ candidates**, where $ k $ is approximately $ \\frac{n}{e} $ (with $ e \\approx 2.718 $). For $ n = 100 $, this gives $ k \\approx 37 $.\n2. **After the initial $ k $ candidates**, accept the **first candidate** who is **better than all the first $ k $ candidates**.\n\n### **Probability of Success:**\n- The probability of selecting the best candidate using this strategy is approximately $ \\frac{1}{e} \\approx 36.8\\% $.\n- For $ n = 100 $, the exact probability is slightly higher due to discrete calculations,",
