    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the setup is that 85% of the taxis in the city are green, and the remaining 15% are blue. There's a witness who saw a taxi, and she says it's blue. But she's not always right; she's correct 80% of the time. The question is asking: what's the probability that the taxi she saw was actually blue?\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic case of conditional probability. Maybe I need to use Bayes' Theorem here. Let me recall Bayes' Theorem. It's about updating probabilities based on new information. The formula is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). So, in this case, event A is the taxi being blue, and event B is the witness saying it's blue. So we need P(Blue | Witness says Blue).\n\nAlright, let's break down the numbers. First, the prior probability of a taxi being blue is 15%, or 0.15. The probability of it being green is 85%, or 0.85. The witness is correct 80% of the time, so if the taxi is blue, the probability she says blue is 80%, which is 0.8. Conversely, if the taxi is green, the probability she says green is 0.8, so the probability she says blue when it's actually green would be 20%, or 0.2.\n\nSo, applying Bayes' Theorem, the numerator would be P(Witness says Blue | Blue) * P(Blue) = 0.8 * 0.15. Let me calculate that: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.\n\nNow, the denominator is P(Witness says Blue), which is the total probability that the witness says blue regardless of the actual color. That can be calculated as P(Witness says Blue | Blue) * P(Blue) + P(Witness says Blue | Green) * P(Green). We already have the first part as 0.12. The second part is 0.2 * 0.85. Let me compute that: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So the total denominator is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the taxi is actually blue given that the witness said blue is 0.12 / 0.29. Let me do that division. 0.12 divided by 0.29. Hmm, 0.12 / 0.29 is approximately 0.4138, so about 41.38%.\n\nWait, that seems low. Even though the witness is 80% accurate, the base rate of blue taxis is only 15%, so even with a correct witness, the probability isn't that high. Because there are more green taxis, so even if the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the number of false positives (saying blue when it's green) might be higher than the true positives (saying blue when it's blue). Let me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal blue taxis: 15%, so 0.15. Witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time, so 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Green taxis: 85%, so 0.85. Witness incorrectly says blue 20% of the time, so 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So total times witness says blue is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Out of those, 0.12 are actual blues. So 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138. Yeah, that seems right. So the probability is roughly 41.4%.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"the probability that the taxi seen by the witness is blue.\" So that's exactly the posterior probability we calculated. So the answer should be approximately 41.4%, which is 12/29 as a fraction. Let me confirm that 12 divided by 29 is indeed approximately 0.4138. Yes, 29*0.4 = 11.6, 29*0.41 = 11.89, 29*0.4138 ≈ 12. So that's correct.\n\nSo even though the witness is 80% accurate, the low base rate of blue taxis (only 15%) means that the probability the taxi is actually blue when the witness says it's blue is about 41.4%. That seems counterintuitive at first, but the math checks out. The key here is that the prior probability (base rate) of the taxi being blue is much lower than green, so even with a relatively accurate witness, the number of false positives (green taxis misidentified as blue) outweighs the true positives (blue taxis correctly identified as blue). Therefore, the probability is less than 50%, which might be surprising but is the correct result based on the given numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the taxi seen by the witness is actually blue, given that the witness reported it as blue, is **approximately 41.4%** (or **12/29** as a fraction). Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Base Rates**:\n   - Probability of a taxi being **blue**: 15% (0.15).\n   - Probability of a taxi being **green**: 85% (0.85).\n\n2. **Witness Accuracy**:\n   - If the taxi is **blue**, the witness correctly identifies it as blue **80%** of the time (0.8).\n   - If the taxi is **green**, the witness incorrectly identifies it as blue **20%** of the time (0.2).\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:\n   $$\n   P(\\text{Blue} \\mid \\text{Witness says Blue}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Witness says Blue} \\mid \\text{Blue}) \\cdot P(\\text{Blue})}{P(\\text{Witness says Blue})}\n   $$\n   - **Numerator**: $0.8 \\times 0.15 = 0.12$ (true positives).\n   - **Denominator**: Total probability the witness says \"blue\":\n     $$\n     P(\\text{Witness says Blue}) = (0.8 \\times 0.15) + (0.2 \\times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\n     $$\n   - **Result**: $\\frac{0.12}{0.29} \\approx 0.4138$ (41.4%).\n\n### Intuition:\nEven though the witness is 80% accurate, the **low base rate of blue taxis (15%)** means that **false positives** (green taxis misidentified as blue) are more common than **true positives** (blue taxis correctly identified). This results in a posterior probability of ~41.4%, not 80%.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Approximately 41.4%** (or **12/29**).",
