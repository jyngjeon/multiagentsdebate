    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the expected ratio of boys to girls in a country where every family keeps having children until they have a boy. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that in most countries, the natural sex ratio at birth is roughly 105 boys to 100 girls, but maybe the question assumes a 50-50 chance for simplicity. The problem says all families want a boy and stop once they have one. So each family will have at least one child, which is a boy. But some families might have multiple children if they have girls first.\n\nLet me think about the probability. If each birth is independent and has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl, then for each family, the number of children they have depends on how many girls they have before a boy. So the first child has a 50% chance of being a boy, which would mean the family stops. If it's a girl (50%), they have another child. Then again, 50% chance for a boy, and so on.\n\nThis sounds like a geometric distribution. The expected number of trials until the first success (in this case, having a boy) is 1/p, where p is the probability of success. Since p is 0.5, the expected number of children per family is 2. That would mean each family has 1 boy and 1 girl on average? Wait, but that can't be right because if they stop after the first boy, the number of girls would be the number of failures before the first success.\n\nWait, the expected number of girls per family would be the expected number of failures before the first success. For a geometric distribution, the expected number of failures is (1-p)/p. So with p=0.5, that would be (1-0.5)/0.5 = 1. So each family is expected to have 1 girl and 1 boy. Therefore, the ratio would be 1:1?\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. If families stop after having a boy, wouldn't there be more boys? But maybe not because the probability of each birth is independent. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose there are 1000 families. Each family has children until they get a boy. Let's simulate:\n\n- First round: 1000 families have 1 child each. 500 are boys, 500 are girls. The 500 families with boys stop. The 500 with girls continue.\n\n- Second round: 500 families have another child. 250 boys, 250 girls. Now, 250 families have a boy and stop. Total boys so far: 500 + 250 = 750. Girls: 500 + 250 = 750. The remaining 250 families continue.\n\n- Third round: 250 families have another child. 125 boys, 125 girls. Total boys: 750 + 125 = 875. Girls: 750 + 125 = 875. Remaining families: 125.\n\n- Fourth round: 125 families have another child. 62.5 boys, 62.5 girls. Total boys: 875 + 62.5 = 937.5. Girls: 875 + 62.5 = 937.5. Remaining families: 62.5.\n\nThis seems to keep going, but the total number of boys and girls are equal at each step. So even though families stop after having a boy, the expected number of girls and boys ends up being the same. Therefore, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nBut wait, the expected number of children per family is 2, so total children would be 2000 for 1000 families. Since each family has exactly one boy, total boys are 1000, and the rest are girls, which would be 1000. So 1000 boys and 1000 girls. Hence, 1:1 ratio.\n\nBut I remember hearing that the ratio remains 1:1 even with this policy. So maybe the answer is 1:1. But why does that happen? Because even though families stop after a boy, the probability of each birth is still 50-50, so the number of girls and boys balances out over time.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that since families stop after a boy, there would be more boys, but the expectation calculation shows that the number of girls is equal to the number of boys. Because each birth is independent, the stopping rule doesn't affect the overall probability. So the expected ratio is still 1:1.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's calculate the expected number of girls per family. For each family, the number of girls is the number of failures before the first success. The expectation is (1-p)/p = 1. So each family has 1 girl on average. Since each family has exactly 1 boy, the total number of boys and girls would be equal. Therefore, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nYes, that seems to confirm it. So the answer should be 1:1.\n</think>\n\nThe expected ratio of boys to girls in the country remains **1:1**, despite the policy of stopping after the birth of a boy. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Probability Model**: Each birth is an independent event with a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl. Families continue having children until a boy is born, ensuring every family has **exactly one boy**.\n\n2. **Expected Number of Children per Family**:  \n   - The number of children per family follows a **geometric distribution** (number of trials until the first success).  \n   - The expected number of children per family is $ \\frac{1}{p} = 2 $ (where $ p = 0.5 $ for a boy).  \n   - This means each family has **1 boy** and **1 girl on average** (since the expected number of girls is $ \\frac{1-p}{p} = 1 $).\n\n3. **Population-Wide Balance**:  \n   - If there are $ N $ families, the total number of boys is $ N $ (one per family).  \n   - The total number of girls is also $ N $ (since each family has an expected 1 girl).  \n   - Thus, the ratio of boys to girls is **1:1**.\n\n4. **Intuition**:  \n   - While families stop after a boy, the stopping rule does not alter the **probability of each birth**. The imbalance in stopping is offset by the fact that families with more girls (and thus more children) are less common, balancing the total counts.\n\n**Conclusion**: The expected ratio of boys to girls remains **equal** (1:1) due to the independence of each birth and the mathematical properties of the geometric distribution.",
