    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a car with 4 tyres and 1 spare. Each tyre can go 20,000 miles before wearing out. We need to find the maximum distance the car can travel before needing a new tyre, and we can change tyres as much as we want. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key here is probably to distribute the wear evenly among all the tyres. Since there are 5 tyres in total (4 on the car at any time, plus 1 spare), maybe we can rotate them so that each tyre is used equally. If each tyre can handle 20,000 miles, then the total \"tyre-miles\" available would be 5 tyres * 20,000 miles = 100,000 tyre-miles. But the car uses 4 tyres at a time, so the maximum distance would be total tyre-miles divided by 4. That would be 100,000 / 4 = 25,000 miles. Wait, that seems right. Because if you spread the usage evenly, each tyre is used for 25,000 miles, but since each can only do 20,000, that would mean that each tyre is used 25,000 miles, but that's more than their limit. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I did that backwards.\n\nWait, total tyre-miles is 5 * 20,000 = 100,000. The car uses 4 tyres at a time, so the total distance would be 100,000 / 4 = 25,000. But that would mean that each tyre is used for 25,000 miles, but each tyre can only handle 20,000. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about it differently. If each tyre can be used for 20,000 miles, and we have 5 tyres, how can we maximize the distance? Let's say that over the course of the trip, each tyre is used for a certain fraction of the total distance. Let me think. If we can rotate the tyres so that each one is used equally, then the total distance would be such that each tyre is used for (total distance) * (number of tyres used at a time) / total number of tyres. Wait, that might be the way.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let D be the total distance. At any time, 4 tyres are in use. So, the total \"tyre-miles\" used is 4D. Since we have 5 tyres, each can be used up to 20,000 miles. Therefore, the total tyre-miles available is 5 * 20,000 = 100,000. Therefore, 4D = 100,000 => D = 25,000. But that would mean that each tyre is used for 4D / 5 = 4*25,000 /5 = 20,000 miles. Wait, that works! Because each tyre is used for 20,000 miles. So, if you can rotate them so that each tyre is used exactly 20,000 miles, then the total distance is 25,000. That makes sense. So the answer is 25,000 miles.\n\nBut how do you actually rotate them? Let me think. For example, if you drive a certain distance, then replace one tyre with the spare, then drive another distance, etc. But how to distribute the wear. Let's say you drive x miles, then replace one tyre with the spare. Then drive another x miles, replace another tyre, etc. But maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each tyre can be used for 20,000 miles. Since there are 5 tyres, the total distance is (5/4)*20,000 = 25,000. That's the same as before. So the maximum distance is 25,000 miles. Therefore, the answer is 25,000 miles. But I need to make sure that this is possible with the rotation.\n\nLet me try with an example. Suppose the total distance is 25,000 miles. Each tyre is used for 20,000 miles. So, each tyre is used for 20,000 / 25,000 = 0.8 of the total distance. So, each tyre is on the car for 80% of the trip. Since there are 5 tyres, and each is used for 80% of the trip, the total usage is 5 * 0.8 = 4, which is exactly the number of tyres needed for the entire trip. That checks out. So, the idea is that each tyre is used for 80% of the total distance, and the spare is used as needed to rotate.\n\nSo, for example, you could divide the trip into 5 equal parts, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, you can rotate the tyres so that each one is used for 20,000 miles. So, if you have 5 tyres, each can be used for 20,000 miles, but since you can only use 4 at a time, you need to rotate them so that each one is used for 20,000 miles over the total distance. Therefore, the total distance is 25,000.\n\nI think that's the answer. But let me check if there's another way. Suppose you drive 10,000 miles, then replace all 4 tyres with the spare. Wait, but you only have one spare. So you can't replace all 4. So that approach wouldn't work. Alternatively, you can rotate one tyre at a time. For example, drive 5,000 miles, then replace one tyre with the spare. Then drive another 5,000 miles, replace another tyre, etc. But how does that add up?\n\nLet me try that. Suppose you drive 5,000 miles. Then, each of the 4 tyres has 15,000 miles left. Then, you replace one tyre with the spare. Now, the spare is used for the next 5,000 miles. Then, after another 5,000 miles, the spare has 15,000 miles left, and the tyre that was replaced has 15,000 miles. Then, you can replace another tyre with the spare. Wait, but this seems like you can keep rotating, but how does that add up?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum distance is 20,000 miles. But that seems too low. Because if you have a spare, you can use it to replace a worn-out tyre. But if you can rotate them, you can get more distance. So 25,000 seems better.\n\nAnother way: think of the total wear. Each tyre can be used for 20,000 miles. So, if you have 5 tyres, the total wear is 5*20,000 = 100,000. The car uses 4 tyres at a time, so the total distance is 100,000 / 4 = 25,000. That's the same as before. So that seems to be the answer.\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance is 25,000 miles.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum distance the car can travel before needing a new tyre is **25,000 miles**. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Total Tyre-Miles Available**:  \n   Each of the 5 tyres (4 in use + 1 spare) can endure 20,000 miles. Thus, the total \"tyre-miles\" available is:  \n   $$\n   5 \\text{ tyres} \\times 20,000 \\text{ miles} = 100,000 \\text{ tyre-miles}.\n   $$\n\n2. **Tyre Usage per Mile**:  \n   The car uses 4 tyres simultaneously. Over the total distance $ D $, the total tyre-miles consumed is:  \n   $$\n   4D \\text{ tyre-miles}.\n   $$\n\n3. **Equating Total Tyre-Miles**:  \n   To ensure no tyre exceeds its 20,000-mile limit, the total tyre-miles consumed must equal the total available:  \n   $$\n   4D = 100,000 \\implies D = \\frac{100,000}{4} = 25,000 \\text{ miles}.\n   $$\n\n4. **Even Wear Distribution**:  \n   At 25,000 miles, each tyre is used for:  \n   $$\n   \\frac{4D}{5} = \\frac{4 \\times 25,000}{5} = 20,000 \\text{ miles}.\n   $$  \n   This ensures all tyres are worn out exactly at 20,000 miles, maximizing the distance.\n\n**Conclusion**: By rotating tyres evenly, the car can travel **25,000 miles** before all tyres are worn out.",
