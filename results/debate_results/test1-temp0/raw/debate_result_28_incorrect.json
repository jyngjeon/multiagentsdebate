    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So there's this problem about two trains. The first one leaves a station going north at 75 mph. Then three hours later, another train leaves the same station, also going north but faster, at 90 mph. The question is, how long will it take for the second train to catch up to the first one?\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the time it takes for the second train to catch up. Let me think. When the second train starts, the first train has already been traveling for three hours. So by the time the second train departs, the first train is already some distance ahead. That distance would be speed multiplied by time, right? So 75 mph times 3 hours. Let me calculate that: 75 * 3 = 225 miles. So the first train is 225 miles ahead when the second train starts.\n\nNow, the second train is going faster, 90 mph compared to the first train's 75 mph. So the relative speed between the two trains is the difference in their speeds. That would be 90 - 75 = 15 mph. So the second train is gaining on the first train at 15 miles per hour. \n\nTo catch up, the second train needs to cover the 225-mile gap at this relative speed. Time is equal to distance divided by speed, so the time it takes would be 225 miles divided by 15 mph. Let me do that division: 225 / 15 = 15. So that would be 15 hours. \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. If the second train is going 15 mph faster, then every hour it closes the gap by 15 miles. So after 1 hour, the gap is 210 miles, after 2 hours, 195, and so on. After 15 hours, the gap would be 225 - (15*15) = 225 - 225 = 0. Yeah, that checks out. So the answer is 15 hours.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is to set up equations for the distance each train has traveled. Let me try that approach to confirm. Let's let t be the time the second train has been traveling when it catches up. Then the first train has been traveling for t + 3 hours. The distance each has traveled should be equal when they meet.\n\nSo, distance for first train: 75*(t + 3)\nDistance for second train: 90*t\nSet them equal: 75(t + 3) = 90t\nExpanding the left side: 75t + 225 = 90t\nSubtract 75t from both sides: 225 = 15t\nDivide both sides by 15: t = 15. Yep, same answer. So that's consistent.\n\nSo both methods give me 15 hours. That seems right. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. The key was to account for the head start of the first train and then figure out the relative speed. Since the second train is faster, it will eventually catch up, and the time needed is the initial distance divided by the relative speed. All steps make sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe second train will take **15 hours** to catch up to the first train. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Head Start Distance**:  \n   The first train travels for 3 hours before the second train departs:  \n   $ 75 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 225 \\, \\text{miles} $.\n\n2. **Relative Speed**:  \n   The second train closes the gap at a rate of:  \n   $ 90 \\, \\text{mph} - 75 \\, \\text{mph} = 15 \\, \\text{mph} $.\n\n3. **Time to Catch Up**:  \n   Time = Distance / Relative Speed:  \n   $ \\frac{225 \\, \\text{miles}}{15 \\, \\text{mph}} = 15 \\, \\text{hours} $.\n\n**Verification via Equations**:  \nLet $ t $ be the time the second train travels. The first train travels $ t + 3 $ hours. Setting distances equal:  \n$ 75(t + 3) = 90t $  \nSolving:  \n$ 75t + 225 = 90t $  \n$ 225 = 15t $  \n$ t = 15 \\, \\text{hours} $.\n\n**Answer**: 15 hours.",
