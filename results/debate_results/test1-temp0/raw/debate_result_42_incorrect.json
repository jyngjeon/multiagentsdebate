    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a car with 4 tyres and 1 spare. Each tyre can go 20,000 miles before wearing out. We need to find the maximum distance the car can travel before needing a new tyre, and we can change tyres as much as we want. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key here is probably to distribute the wear evenly among all the tyres. Since there are 5 tyres in total (4 on the car and 1 spare), maybe we can rotate them so that each tyre is used equally. If each tyre can handle 20,000 miles, then the total \"tyre-miles\" available would be 5 tyres * 20,000 miles = 100,000 tyre-miles.\n\nBut the car uses 4 tyres at a time. So, if we divide the total tyre-miles by the number of tyres used at once, that should give the maximum distance. So 100,000 divided by 4 equals 25,000 miles. That seems right. Wait, but let me think again.\n\nLet me check with an example. Suppose we drive 20,000 miles. Each of the 4 tyres would be used up, but we have a spare. But if we rotate them, maybe we can use the spare in place of one of the others. So, if we rotate the tyres so that each one is used for a portion of the trip.\n\nFor instance, if we drive a certain distance, then replace one tyre with the spare, then drive another distance, and so on. The idea is that each tyre is used for the same amount of time. So, if we have 5 tyres, each can be used for 20,000 miles. But since the car needs 4 tyres at all times, the total distance would be (5 * 20,000) / 4 = 25,000 miles. That seems to make sense.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: each tyre can be used for 20,000 miles. If we have 5 tyres, and we want to spread the usage, then each tyre would be used for (total distance) * (4/5) miles. Because at any time, 4 out of 5 tyres are in use. So, if each tyre is used for (4/5) of the total distance, then:\n\nTotal distance * (4/5) = 20,000 miles per tyre.\n\nSolving for total distance: total distance = (20,000 * 5) / 4 = 25,000 miles. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, the maximum distance is 25,000 miles. That seems to be the answer. But let me check if there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can do some kind of rotation where you use the spare more efficiently. For example, if you drive a certain distance, then swap out a tyre with the spare, and then drive another distance, and so on. But in that case, each tyre would be used for different parts of the journey. However, the total wear would still be the same. So, if you have 5 tyres, each can be used for 20,000 miles. The total wear is 5*20,000 = 100,000. Since the car uses 4 tyres at a time, the total distance is 100,000 / 4 = 25,000. So that's the same as before.\n\nAnother way: think of it as each tyre can be used for 20,000 miles. If you have 5 tyres, you can rotate them so that each one is used for 20,000 miles. But since the car needs 4 tyres at a time, the total distance is (5/4)*20,000 = 25,000. That's the same answer again.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 25,000 miles. But wait, is there a scenario where you can go further? Let me think. Suppose you drive 20,000 miles, but you have 4 tyres. Then you have to replace all 4, but you have a spare. Wait, but if you drive 20,000 miles, each of the 4 tyres is used up. Then you can't go any further because all 4 are worn out. But if you rotate them, you can use the spare to replace one of the tyres, allowing you to drive more.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach is correct. Let me think of it as a resource allocation problem. The total amount of \"tyre usage\" is 5*20,000 = 100,000. Since the car uses 4 tyres at a time, the maximum distance is 100,000 / 4 = 25,000. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if you have 5 tyres, each can be used for 20,000 miles. So, if you can rotate them so that each tyre is used for 20,000 miles, but since the car needs 4 tyres at a time, the total distance is (5/4)*20,000 = 25,000. That's the same as before.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 25,000 miles. Therefore, the maximum distance the car can travel is 25,000 miles before needing a new tyre.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum distance the car can travel before needing a new tyre is **25,000 miles**. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Total Tyre Capacity**: There are 5 tyres (4 in use + 1 spare), each capable of traveling 20,000 miles. This gives a total \"tyre-miles\" capacity of:  \n   $$\n   5 \\text{ tyres} \\times 20,000 \\text{ miles} = 100,000 \\text{ tyre-miles}.\n   $$\n\n2. **Usage Distribution**: The car uses 4 tyres at all times. To maximize distance, the wear must be evenly distributed across all 5 tyres. This means each tyre will be used for a fraction of the total distance. Let $ D $ be the total distance. Since 4 tyres are used simultaneously, the total tyre-miles consumed is:  \n   $$\n   4D.\n   $$\n\n3. **Equating Capacity and Usage**: The total tyre-miles consumed must equal the total capacity:  \n   $$\n   4D = 100,000 \\implies D = \\frac{100,000}{4} = 25,000 \\text{ miles}.\n   $$\n\n4. **Verification**: If each tyre is used for $ \\frac{4}{5} $ of the total distance (since 4 out of 5 tyres are in use at any time), the wear per tyre is:  \n   $$\n   D \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 25,000 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 20,000 \\text{ miles},\n   $$  \n   which matches the maximum allowable wear per tyre.\n\n**Conclusion**: By rotating tyres optimally, the car can travel **25,000 miles** before all tyres are worn out.",
