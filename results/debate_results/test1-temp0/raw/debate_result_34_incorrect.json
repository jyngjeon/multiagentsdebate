    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best strategy to maximize the probability of selecting the best candidate out of 100, given that they come in a random order and I can only decide to accept or reject each one as they come, with no going back. Hmm, I remember something about the \"secretary problem\" from probability. Let me think.\n\nThe problem is classic, right? The idea is that you can't go back once you've rejected someone, so you need a strategy that balances between looking at enough candidates to get a sense of the quality and then picking the first one that's better than all the previous ones. But how exactly does that work?\n\nI think the optimal strategy is to reject the first n/e candidates (where e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.718) and then pick the next candidate who is better than all the ones you've seen so far. For 100 candidates, n is 100, so n/e is about 37. So you reject the first 37 candidates, and then choose the first one after that who is better than all the first 37. That gives a probability of about 1/e, which is roughly 36.8%, right?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The exact formula for the probability is 1/(n) * sum_{k=1}^{n} (1/k) for the first n candidates? No, that might be for something else. Wait, the probability when using the optimal strategy is approximately 1/e, which is about 36.8% for large n. For n=100, it's close to that. But maybe the exact value is slightly different?\n\nLet me try to recall the derivation. The idea is that you set a threshold, say, the first m candidates, and you don't select any of them. Then, you select the first candidate after m that is better than all the first m. The probability that the best candidate is in the remaining n - m positions, and that it's the first one that's better than the first m. \n\nSo the probability that the best candidate is in position k (where k > m) is 1/n. For each such k, the probability that the best candidate is at k and that all candidates before k (from m+1 to k-1) are not better than the first m. Wait, no, actually, the probability that the best candidate is in the second part (after m) and that it's the first one that's better than the first m. \n\nSo the probability that the best candidate is in the second part is (n - m)/n. Then, given that, the probability that the first candidate in the second part that is better than all the first m is the best one. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the best candidate is in the second part and that it is the first one that is better than the first m. For each position k from m+1 to n, the probability that the best candidate is at k and that all candidates before k (from 1 to k-1) have their maximum less than the candidate at k. Wait, but the maximum of the first k-1 candidates must be less than the candidate at k. However, since the best candidate is at k, the maximum of the first k-1 is not the best, so that's already satisfied. But the candidate at k must be better than the first m candidates. Wait, no, the strategy is to pick the first candidate after m that is better than all the first m. So if the best candidate is after m, then the probability that it is the first one that is better than the first m. \n\nBut the first m candidates are all rejected, so the maximum of the first m is some value. Then, the best candidate is in the remaining n - m positions. The probability that the best candidate is in the second part is (n - m)/n. Then, given that, the probability that the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first m. \n\nBut how do we calculate that? For the best candidate to be selected, it must be that the best candidate is in the second part, and that all candidates before it in the second part are not better than the first m. Wait, no. The strategy is to pick the first candidate in the second part that is better than all the first m. So if the best candidate is in the second part, then the probability that it is the first one in the second part that is better than the first m. \n\nBut the first m candidates are fixed. Let's say the best candidate is at position k (k > m). The probability that the best candidate is at k is 1/n. Then, the probability that all candidates from m+1 to k-1 are not better than the first m. Wait, but the first m candidates have their own maximum. Let me denote the maximum of the first m candidates as M. Then, the candidate at position k must be better than M. However, since the best candidate is at k, then M is not the best, so the maximum of the first m is less than the best candidate. Therefore, the candidate at k is better than M. But the problem is that the candidates from m+1 to k-1 could have some candidates that are better than M. If any of them are better than M, then the strategy would have picked that candidate instead of the best one. Therefore, the probability that the best candidate is selected is the probability that the best candidate is in the second part and that all candidates before it in the second part are not better than the first m. \n\nSo for each k from m+1 to n, the probability that the best candidate is at k and that the maximum of the first k-1 candidates is less than the candidate at k. Wait, but the maximum of the first k-1 candidates is the maximum of the first m and the candidates from m+1 to k-1. So if the best candidate is at k, then the maximum of the first k-1 is less than the candidate at k. However, the strategy is to pick the first candidate after m that is better than the first m. Therefore, if the best candidate is at k, then the probability that none of the candidates from m+1 to k-1 are better than the first m. \n\nBut the first m candidates have their own maximum. Let me think of it this way: For the best candidate to be selected, it must be that the best candidate is in the second part (positions m+1 to n), and that the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first m is the best candidate. \n\nSo the probability that the best candidate is in the second part is (n - m)/n. Then, given that, the probability that the best candidate is the first one in the second part that is better than the first m. \n\nBut how do we compute that? Let's consider that the best candidate is in the second part. Then, the probability that the first candidate in the second part that is better than the first m is the best candidate. \n\nThis is equivalent to the best candidate being the first one in the second part that is better than the first m. \n\nAlternatively, the probability that the best candidate is in the second part and that all candidates before it in the second part are not better than the first m. \n\nBut since the best candidate is in the second part, the candidates before it in the second part (positions m+1 to k-1) must not be better than the first m. \n\nBut the first m candidates have their own maximum. Let me denote the maximum of the first m as M. Then, the candidates from m+1 to k-1 must all be less than M. However, since the best candidate is at k, which is better than M, but the candidates from m+1 to k-1 could be either less than M or between M and the best candidate. \n\nWait, but if any of the candidates from m+1 to k-1 are better than M, then the strategy would have picked that candidate instead of the best one. Therefore, the probability that the best candidate is selected is the probability that the best candidate is in the second part and that all candidates in the second part before it are not better than the first m. \n\nSo for each k from m+1 to n, the probability that the best candidate is at k and that the maximum of the first k-1 candidates is less than the candidate at k. But since the best candidate is at k, the maximum of the first k-1 is less than the candidate at k. However, the maximum of the first k-1 is the maximum of the first m and the candidates from m+1 to k-1. Therefore, the maximum of the first m must be greater than all the candidates from m+1 to k-1. \n\nWait, no. If the maximum of the first k-1 is less than the candidate at k, then the maximum of the first m must be less than the candidate at k. But since the candidate at k is the best, the maximum of the first m is less than the best candidate. However, the candidates from m+1 to k-1 could be either less than the maximum of the first m or not. \n\nBut for the strategy to pick the best candidate, the candidates from m+1 to k-1 must not be better than the first m. That is, the maximum of the first m must be greater than all the candidates from m+1 to k-1. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the best candidate is at position k and that the maximum of the first m is greater than all candidates from m+1 to k-1. \n\nSo the probability for each k is (1/n) * [probability that the maximum of the first m is greater than all candidates from m+1 to k-1]. \n\nBut how do we compute that? \n\nThe probability that the maximum of the first m is greater than all the candidates from m+1 to k-1. Since all candidates are randomly ordered, the relative order of the first m and the next (k - m - 1) candidates is random. The maximum of the first m is the maximum of m elements, and the maximum of the next (k - m - 1) elements. The probability that the maximum of the first m is greater than the maximum of the next (k - m - 1) elements is equal to m / (m + (k - m - 1)) ) = m / (k - 1). \n\nWait, that seems familiar. Because if you have two groups of elements, the probability that the maximum of the first group is greater than the maximum of the second group is equal to the size of the first group divided by the total size of both groups. \n\nYes, that's a standard result. For example, if you have two sets of elements, the probability that the maximum of the first set is greater than the maximum of the second set is equal to the size of the first set divided by the total size of both sets. \n\nSo in this case, the first group is the first m candidates, and the second group is the candidates from m+1 to k-1, which is (k - m - 1) candidates. The total number of candidates in both groups is m + (k - m - 1) = k - 1. Therefore, the probability that the maximum of the first m is greater than the maximum of the next (k - m - 1) is m / (k - 1). \n\nTherefore, the probability that the best candidate is at position k and that the maximum of the first m is greater than all the candidates from m+1 to k-1 is (1/n) * [m / (k - 1)]. \n\nTherefore, the total probability of success is the sum over k from m+1 to n of (1/n) * [m / (k - 1)]. \n\nSo that's (m/n) * sum_{k=m+1}^n [1/(k - 1)] = (m/n) * sum_{i=m}^{n-1} [1/i] = (m/n) * [H_{n-1} - H_{m-1}], where H_n is the nth harmonic number. \n\nBut we want to choose m to maximize this probability. \n\nFor large n, the harmonic numbers can be approximated by ln(n) + γ, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (~0.5772). Therefore, H_{n-1} - H_{m-1} ≈ ln(n - 1) - ln(m - 1) ≈ ln(n/m). \n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately (m/n) * ln(n/m). \n\nTo maximize this expression, take derivative with respect to m. Let me set x = m/n, so that the expression becomes x * ln(1/x) = -x ln x. The maximum of -x ln x occurs at x = 1/e, so m ≈ n/e. \n\nTherefore, the optimal m is approximately n/e, and the maximum probability is approximately 1/e ≈ 36.8%. \n\nBut for exact value with n=100, we need to compute the exact value. The optimal m is floor(n/e) or ceil(n/e). For n=100, e≈2.718, so 100/e ≈ 36.7879, so m=37. \n\nThen, the exact probability is sum_{k=37}^{99} [37 / (k)] * (1/100). Wait, no, earlier we had (m/n) * [H_{n-1} - H_{m-1}]. So for m=37, n=100, it's (37/100) * [H_{99} - H_{36}]. \n\nCalculating H_{99} and H_{36} would give the exact value. But since harmonic numbers can be approximated, H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + ... \n\nBut maybe for the purposes of the answer, the approximate probability is 1/e ≈ 36.8%, and the exact value for n=100 is approximately 37% or so. \n\nAlternatively, the exact probability can be calculated as follows. The probability is sum_{k=m+1}^n [m / (k(k - 1))] ? Wait, no, earlier we had (m/n) * sum_{k=m+1}^n [1/(k - 1)] which is (m/n) * sum_{i=m}^{n-1} [1/i]. \n\nSo for m=37, n=100, the probability is (37/100) * [H_{99} - H_{36}]. \n\nCalculating H_{99} - H_{36} is the same as sum_{i=37}^{99} 1/i. \n\nBut H_{99} ≈ ln(99) + γ + 1/(2*99) - 1/(12*99^2) ≈ ln(99) + 0.5772 + 0.00505 - 0.000008 ≈ ln(99) + 0.5822. Similarly, H_{36} ≈ ln(36) + γ + 1/(2*36) - 1/(12*36^2) ≈ ln(36) + 0.5772 + 0.01389 - 0.00003 ≈ ln(36) + 0.59106. \n\nTherefore, H_{99} - H_{36} ≈ [ln(99) + 0.5822] - [ln(36) + 0.59106] = ln(99/36) - 0.00886 ≈ ln(2.75) - 0.00886 ≈ 1.0116 - 0.00886 ≈ 1.0027. \n\nThen, the probability is (37/100) * 1.0027 ≈ 0.37 * 1.0027 ≈ 0.37099, so approximately 37.1%. \n\nBut this is an approximation. The exact value would require precise calculation of the harmonic numbers. However, the exact probability for m=37 is known to be approximately 37.1%, which is slightly higher than 1/e (≈36.8%). \n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to reject the first 37 candidates and then select the first candidate after that who is better than all the first 37. The probability of success is approximately 37%, which is close to 1/e. \n\nBut I should check if m=37 is indeed the optimal. For n=100, the exact optimal m is the integer closest to n/e, which is 37. However, sometimes it's better to check m=36 or m=37. For example, for n=100, the exact optimal m is 37, and the probability is approximately 37.1%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the optimal strategy is to reject the first 37 candidates and then choose the first candidate who is better than all the first 37, and the probability of success is approximately 37%, or more precisely, about 37.1%.\n</think>\n\nThe optimal strategy for maximizing the probability of selecting the best candidate out of 100 is derived from the **secretary problem**, a classic problem in probability theory. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Strategy:**\n1. **Reject the first $ m $ candidates** without considering them for selection. This allows you to establish a benchmark for comparison.\n2. **Select the first candidate after the $ m $-th position** who is better than all the first $ m $ candidates.\n\nThe value of $ m $ is chosen to **maximize the probability of success**. For large $ n $, the optimal $ m $ is approximately $ \\frac{n}{e} $, where $ e \\approx 2.718 $ is the base of the natural logarithm. For $ n = 100 $, this gives $ m \\approx \\frac{100}{2.718} \\approx 37 $. Thus, the optimal strategy is to **reject the first 37 candidates** and then **select the first candidate after that who is better than all the first 37**.\n\n---\n\n### **Probability of Success:**\nThe probability of selecting the best candidate using this strategy is approximately $ \\frac{1}{e} \\approx 36.8\\% $. For $ n = 100 $, the exact probability is slightly higher due to the discrete nature of the problem. Precise calculations using harmonic numbers yield a probability of approximately **37.1%**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insight:**\nThe strategy balances **exploration** (rejecting the first $ m $ candidates to establish a benchmark) and **exploitation** (selecting the first candidate after $ m $ that exceeds the benchmark). This approach ensures a high probability of selecting the best candidate without revisiting rejected candidates.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n- **Strategy:** Reject the first 37 candidates, then select the first candidate after that who is better than all the first 37.\n- **Probability of Success:** Approximately **37.1%** (or $ \\frac{1}{e} \\approx 36.8\\% $ for large $ n $).",
