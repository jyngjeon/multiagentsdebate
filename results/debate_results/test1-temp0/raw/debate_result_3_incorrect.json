    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the maximum number of peaches someone can eat with 10 cents, considering that you can exchange 3 peach pits for another peach. Hmm, so first, I need to break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with 10 cents, each peach costs 1 cent, so initially, you can buy 10 peaches. But then, after eating those peaches, you'll have 10 pits. Now, the key part is exchanging those pits for more peaches. Since 3 pits can be exchanged for 1 peach, I need to figure out how many times I can do this exchange.\n\nSo, first purchase: 10 peaches, 10 cents spent, 10 pits collected. Then, exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. That gives me 3 more peaches, but I need to track the pits again. Wait, after exchanging 3 pits for 1 peach, I eat that peach, which gives me another pit. So each time I exchange, I get a new peach and a new pit.\n\nLet me try to outline this step by step:\n\n1. Start with 10 cents.\n2. Buy 10 peaches. Now, 0 cents left, 10 pits.\n3. Exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. Now, 1 peach eaten, 1 pit from that peach. So total peaches eaten: 10 + 1 = 11. Pits remaining: 10 - 3 + 1 = 8.\n4. Now, with 8 pits, can I exchange again? 8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2. So exchange 6 pits for 2 peaches. Eat those 2, so total peaches: 11 + 2 = 13. Pits now: 8 - 6 + 2 = 4.\n5. Now, 4 pits. Exchange 3 for 1 peach. Eat it, total peaches: 13 + 1 = 14. Pits remaining: 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n6. Now, 2 pits left. Not enough to exchange for another peach. So total is 14?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to get more? Let me check again. Maybe I missed some steps.\n\nAlternatively, after step 3, I had 8 pits. Then step 4: exchange 6 for 2 peaches, which gives 2 pits. Then step 5: exchange 3 for 1 peach, leaving 2 pits. Then, after eating that 1 peach, I have 2 + 1 = 3 pits again? Wait, no. Wait, after step 5, I had 2 pits. Then I exchange 3 pits for 1 peach, but I only have 2. So that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, in step 5, after exchanging 3 pits for 1 peach, I eat it, which gives me 1 pit. So the pits after step 5 would be 4 - 3 + 1 = 2. Then, I can't exchange again. So total is 14.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to exchange. Let me think. Suppose after step 3, I have 8 pits. If I exchange 3 pits for 1 peach, then I have 8 - 3 = 5 pits, plus 1 from the new peach, so 6 pits. Then, exchange 3 for 1 peach again, which would be 6 - 3 = 3 pits, plus 1 from the new peach, so 4 pits. Then exchange 3 for 1 peach again, leaving 4 - 3 = 1 pit, plus 1 from the new peach, total 2 pits. So that would be 3 more peaches, making total 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13? Wait, that seems different. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's go through that again. Starting with 8 pits after step 3.\n\nFirst exchange: 3 pits for 1 peach. Eat it, so pits now 8 - 3 = 5, plus 1 from the eaten peach = 6. Total peaches eaten: 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nSecond exchange: 3 pits for 1 peach. Pits now 6 - 3 = 3, plus 1 = 4. Total peaches: 11 + 1 = 12.\n\nThird exchange: 3 pits for 1 peach. Pits now 4 - 3 = 1, plus 1 = 2. Total peaches: 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nSo that's 13, but earlier I had 14. Wait, why the discrepancy? Because in my first approach, after step 4, I had 4 pits, then exchanged 3 for 1, leading to 2 pits. But in this approach, after step 3, I had 8 pits, then exchanged 3, then 3, then 3, leading to 13. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n1. Buy 10 peaches, 10 cents, 10 pits.\n\n2. Exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. Now, 10 - 3 = 7 pits, plus 1 from the new peach = 8 pits. Total peaches: 10 + 1 = 11.\n\n3. Exchange 6 pits (3*2) for 2 peaches. So 8 - 6 = 2 pits, plus 2 from the new peaches = 4 pits. Total peaches: 11 + 2 = 13.\n\n4. Exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. 4 - 3 = 1 pit, plus 1 from the new peach = 2 pits. Total peaches: 13 + 1 = 14.\n\nAh, so in this case, after step 3, you have 4 pits. Then exchange 3 for 1, leading to 2 pits. So total 14. But in the other approach, when I did step by step exchanges, I only got 13. So why the difference?\n\nBecause in the first approach, after step 3, you have 4 pits. Then you can exchange 3 for 1, which gives you 1 more peach. So that's 14. But in the other approach, I thought I had 8 pits after step 3, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Wait, in the first approach, after step 3, you had 8 pits. Then step 4 is exchanging 6 pits (3*2) for 2 peaches. So that's 8 - 6 = 2 pits, plus 2 from the new peaches = 4. Then step 5 is exchanging 3 for 1, leading to 4 - 3 = 1 + 1 = 2. So that's 14. But in the other approach, when I did step by step, I had 8 pits, then exchanged 3, then 3, then 3, but that would require 3 exchanges. Wait, but in that case, after first exchange, 8-3=5, +1=6. Then exchange 3, 6-3=3, +1=4. Then exchange 3, 4-3=1, +1=2. So that's 3 exchanges, giving 3 more peaches. So total would be 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the problem is that when you exchange 3 pits for 1 peach, you get 1 peach, which you eat, giving you 1 pit. So each exchange of 3 pits gives you 1 peach and 1 pit. Therefore, the number of peaches you can get from the pits is not just the number of exchanges, but also the pits you get from eating the exchanged peaches.\n\nSo, in the first approach, after step 3, you have 8 pits. Then, you can do two exchanges of 3 pits each (total 6 pits), getting 2 peaches, which gives you 2 pits. So total pits after that is 8 - 6 + 2 = 4. Then, exchange 3 pits for 1 peach, getting 1 pit. So total pits 4 - 3 + 1 = 2. So that's 2 more peaches (from the two exchanges) and 1 more peach, total 3 more, making 10 + 3 = 13? Wait, no. Wait, initial 10 peaches, then 1 from first exchange, then 2 from the next exchange, then 1 from the last exchange. So total 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 14. Wait, that's 14. But in the other approach, when I did step by step, I thought I had 3 exchanges, but that would be 3 peaches. But why the difference?\n\nAh, I think the confusion is in how many exchanges you can do. Let me try to model this as a loop.\n\nStart with 10 cents: buy 10 peaches, 10 pits.\n\nThen, while you have at least 3 pits:\n\n- Exchange 3 pits for 1 peach.\n\n- Eat the peach, which gives you 1 pit.\n\nSo, each time you exchange 3 pits, you get 1 peach and 1 pit. So the net loss of pits is 2 per exchange (since you give 3, get 1 back). But the number of peaches increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, starting with 10 pits:\n\nFirst exchange: 10 - 3 = 7, +1 = 8 pits. Peaches: 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nSecond exchange: 8 - 3 = 5, +1 = 6. Peaches: 12.\n\nThird exchange: 6 - 3 = 3, +1 = 4. Peaches: 13.\n\nFourth exchange: 4 - 3 = 1, +1 = 2. Peaches: 14.\n\nFifth exchange: 2 pits, can't exchange. So total is 14.\n\nSo that's 4 exchanges, giving 4 more peaches, total 14. So that's the correct answer. So the initial approach was correct. The confusion in the other approach was because I thought of exchanging 6 pits at once, but actually, each exchange is 3 pits for 1 peach, and you can do that as many times as possible, each time reducing the number of pits by 2 (since you give 3, get 1 back). So with 10 pits, you can do 4 exchanges (each time using 3 pits, but getting 1 back), leading to 4 more peaches.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me check the number of exchanges:\n\nStart with 10 pits.\n\nExchange 3: 10-3=7, +1=8. (1 exchange)\n\nExchange 3: 8-3=5, +1=6. (2 exchanges)\n\nExchange 3: 6-3=3, +1=4. (3 exchanges)\n\nExchange 3: 4-3=1, +1=2. (4 exchanges)\n\nNow, 2 pits left. So 4 exchanges, 4 peaches. So total peaches: 10 + 4 = 14.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 14.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is using the formula for such problems. The general formula for the maximum number of peaches is initial_peaches + floor((initial_peaches - 1)/ (exchange_rate - 1)). Wait, not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of peaches is the initial number plus the number of times you can exchange the pits, considering that each exchange gives you a new peach and a new pit. This is similar to the classic water jug problem or the coin exchange problem.\n\nAnother approach is to model it as:\n\nTotal peaches = initial_peaches + floor((initial_peaches - 1)/ (exchange_rate - 1)).\n\nBut I need to verify.\n\nIn this case, initial_peaches is 10, exchange_rate is 3 (3 pits for 1 peach). So:\n\nTotal peaches = 10 + floor((10 - 1)/(3 - 1)) = 10 + floor(9/2) = 10 + 4 = 14. Which matches the previous result. So that formula works here.\n\nSo the answer is 14.\n\nBut let me check with another example. Suppose you have 3 cents. Buy 3 peaches, 3 pits. Exchange 3 pits for 1 peach. Total peaches: 3 + 1 = 4. Then, you have 1 pit from the new peach. Can't exchange. So total 4. Using the formula: 3 + floor((3-1)/2) = 3 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 4 cents. Buy 4 peaches, 4 pits. Exchange 3 for 1, now 4-3=1 +1=2 pits. Total peaches 5. Can't exchange. So total 5. Formula: 4 + floor((4-1)/2) = 4 + 1 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 5 cents. Buy 5 peaches, 5 pits. Exchange 3 for 1, 5-3=2 +1=3. Total peaches 6. Now, 3 pits, exchange again: 3-3=0 +1=1. Total peaches 7. Now 1 pit. So total 7. Formula: 5 + floor((5-1)/2) = 5 + 2 = 7. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. Therefore, applying it to 10 cents: 10 + floor((10-1)/2) = 10 + 4 = 14. So the answer is 14.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of peaches you can eat is 14.\n</think>\n\nThe maximal number of peaches you can eat with 10 cents is **14**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Purchase**:  \n   - Spend 10 cents to buy **10 peaches**.  \n   - After eating them, you have **10 peach pits**.\n\n2. **Exchange Process**:  \n   - **First Exchange**: Use 3 pits to get 1 peach. Now, you have **8 pits** (10 - 3 + 1). Total peaches eaten: **11**.  \n   - **Second Exchange**: Use 3 pits to get 1 peach. Now, you have **6 pits** (8 - 3 + 1). Total peaches eaten: **12**.  \n   - **Third Exchange**: Use 3 pits to get 1 peach. Now, you have **4 pits** (6 - 3 + 1). Total peaches eaten: **13**.  \n   - **Fourth Exchange**: Use 3 pits to get 1 peach. Now, you have **2 pits** (4 - 3 + 1). Total peaches eaten: **14**.  \n\n3. **Final Check**:  \n   - With **2 pits** remaining, you cannot perform another exchange (requires 3 pits).  \n\n**Total**: **14 peaches**.  \n\nThis result aligns with the formula:  \n$$\n\\text{Total peaches} = \\text{Initial peaches} + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{Initial peaches} - 1}{\\text{Exchange rate} - 1} \\right\\rfloor\n$$  \n$$\n= 10 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10 - 1}{3 - 1} \\right\\rfloor = 10 + 4 = 14\n$$  \n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{14}$",
