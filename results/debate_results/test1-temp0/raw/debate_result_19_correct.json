    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a flock of birds in a V formation. Initially, there are 25 birds on the left and 25 on the right. Then one bird moves from the left to the right. The question is, how many more birds will be on the right side than the left after this move?\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out the numbers after the bird moves. Let me break it down step by step. \n\nOriginally, left side has 25, right side also 25. So total birds are 25 + 25 = 50. If one bird moves from left to right, then the left side will have 25 - 1 = 24 birds. The right side will have 25 + 1 = 26 birds. \n\nNow, the question is asking how many more birds are on the right than the left. So subtract the left count from the right count. That would be 26 (right) minus 24 (left) = 2. So the answer should be 2 more birds on the right side.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The original numbers are equal, 25 each. Moving one bird from left to right reduces left by 1 and increases right by 1. So the difference between right and left becomes (25 +1) - (25 -1) = 26 -24 = 2. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nIs there any other factor I need to consider? Like, does the V formation have a middle bird or something? The problem says left and right sides, so maybe the middle is not counted here. The problem states 25 on each side, so moving one from left to right would just adjust those numbers. \n\nAnother way to think: the difference before the move is 0. After moving one bird, the difference is 2. So the answer is 2. I think that's straightforward. Maybe the trick is that people might think it's 1, but actually, since you're subtracting one from left and adding one to right, the difference doubles? Wait, no. The original difference is 0. After moving, the difference is 2. So the answer is 2. \n\nI don't see any other angles here. The problem seems pretty direct. So the answer should be 2.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a simple arithmetic adjustment. Initially, both sides of the V formation have 25 birds. When one bird moves from the left to the right:  \n- **Left side**: $25 - 1 = 24$ birds.  \n- **Right side**: $25 + 1 = 26$ birds.  \n\nThe difference between the right and left sides is:  \n$$\n26 - 24 = 2.\n$$  \n\n**Answer:** The right side will have **2 more birds** than the left side.",

    "question": "A flock of birds is flying in a V formation. There are 25 birds on the left side of the V and 25 birds on the right side. If one bird from the left side moves to the right side, how many more birds will be on the right side than the left side?",
    "answer": [
        "2"
    ],
    "explanation": "When one bird moves from the left side to the right side, the left side loses one bird, and the right side gains one bird. So, the difference between the two sides increases by 2. Therefore, after the bird moves, there will be 2 (26 - 24 = 2) more birds on the right side than on the left side.",
    "incorrect answer": [
        "1"
    ],
    "incorrect explanation": "It might seem intuitive to think that since one bird moved from the left side to the right side, the difference between the two sides would only increase by 1. However, this fails to take into account that the left side also loses a bird, effectively increasing the difference by 2.",
    "Whether there is a preference": "Yes",
    "Supported Side": "Affirmative",
    "Reason": "The affirmative side correctly calculates the difference as 2 after one bird moves from the left to the right side. The reasoning is mathematically sound, with no hidden factors or errors in arithmetic.",
