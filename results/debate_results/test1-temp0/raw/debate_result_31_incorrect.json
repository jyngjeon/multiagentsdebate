    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is about the probability that a driver is actually drunk given that the breathalyzer test says they are drunk. Hmm, this sounds like a classic case of conditional probability, maybe Bayes' Theorem?\n\nFirst, let me recall Bayes' Theorem. It's about updating probabilities based on new information. The formula is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). In this case, event A is the driver being drunk, and event B is the breathalyzer indicating drunk. So we need to find P(Drunk | Test Positive).\n\nThe problem states that 1 in 1000 drivers is drunk. So the prior probability P(Drunk) is 1/1000, which is 0.001. Then, the probability of being sober is 1 - 0.001 = 0.999.\n\nThe breathalyzer has a 5% false positive rate. That means if the driver is sober, the test incorrectly says drunk 5% of the time. So P(Test Positive | Sober) = 0.05. And it never fails to detect a truly drunk person, so P(Test Positive | Drunk) = 1.0.\n\nNow, to apply Bayes' Theorem, I need to compute P(Test Positive). This is the total probability of testing positive, which can happen in two ways: either the driver is drunk and tests positive, or the driver is sober but tests positive. So:\n\nP(Test Positive) = P(Test Positive | Drunk) * P(Drunk) + P(Test Positive | Sober) * P(Sober)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(Test Positive) = (1.0 * 0.001) + (0.05 * 0.999) = 0.001 + 0.04995 = 0.05095\n\nThen, applying Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(Drunk | Test Positive) = (1.0 * 0.001) / 0.05095 ≈ 0.001 / 0.05095 ≈ 0.019627, which is approximately 1.96%.\n\nWait, that seems really low. Only about 2% chance that the person is actually drunk even though the test is positive? That seems counterintuitive because the test is supposed to be accurate. But maybe because the base rate of drunk drivers is so low (1 in 1000), most of the positive tests are false positives.\n\nLet me check the calculation again. The prior is 0.001. The false positive rate is 5%, so 5% of 999 sober drivers would be 0.05 * 999 = 49.95. The true positives are 1 (since 1 in 1000 is drunk, and all of them are detected). So total positive tests are 49.95 + 1 = 50.95. Therefore, the probability that a positive test is a true positive is 1 / 50.95 ≈ 0.0196, which is about 1.96%. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo even though the test is 95% accurate in detecting sober people (i.e., 5% false positive), the low base rate of drunk drivers means that most positive tests are false positives. That's the classic base rate fallacy. People often ignore the base rate and focus on the test accuracy, leading to overestimation of the probability.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 2%, or more precisely about 1.96%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the driver is actually drunk given a positive breathalyzer test is approximately **1.96%**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Base Rates**:  \n   - Probability of being drunk: $ P(D) = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001 $  \n   - Probability of being sober: $ P(S) = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999 $\n\n2. **Test Accuracy**:  \n   - False positive rate (sober but test positive): $ P(T^+|S) = 0.05 $  \n   - True positive rate (drunk and test positive): $ P(T^+|D) = 1.0 $\n\n3. **Total Probability of a Positive Test**:  \n   $$\n   P(T^+) = P(T^+|D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T^+|S) \\cdot P(S) = (1.0 \\cdot 0.001) + (0.05 \\cdot 0.999) = 0.001 + 0.04995 = 0.05095\n   $$\n\n4. **Bayes' Theorem**:  \n   $$\n   P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) \\cdot P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{1.0 \\cdot 0.001}{0.05095} \\approx 0.0196 \\, (\\text{or } 1.96\\%)\n   $$\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite the breathalyzer's high accuracy, the extremely low base rate of drunk drivers (1 in 1000) means that most positive tests are false positives. Thus, the probability the driver is actually drunk is **~2%**, not 95% as intuition might suggest. This highlights the importance of considering base rates in probabilistic reasoning.",
