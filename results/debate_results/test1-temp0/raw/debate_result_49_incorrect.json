    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Ram usually arrives at the station at 6 pm, and his wife Sita picks him up right then. They drive home together. But one day, Ram arrives an hour early, so at 5 pm, and starts walking home. Then, after walking a certain distance, he meets Sita, and they drive back home, arriving 30 minutes earlier than usual. The question is, how long was Ram walking?\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the scenario. Normally, Sita leaves home at a certain time to reach the station by 6 pm. Let's assume that the time it takes her to drive from home to the station is T minutes. So, she leaves home at 6 pm minus T minutes. But since she arrives exactly at 6 pm, that's when she meets Ram. Then they drive back home, taking the same T minutes, so they arrive home at 6 pm plus T minutes. Wait, but maybe I need to think about the total time from when she leaves home to when they get back. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me denote some variables. Let's say the distance from home to the station is D. Let Sita's driving speed be V. Then, normally, the time it takes her to drive from home to the station is D/V. So, she leaves home at 6 pm minus D/V, arrives at the station at 6 pm, picks up Ram, and they drive back home, arriving at 6 pm plus D/V. So, the usual time they arrive home is 6 pm plus D/V.\n\nBut on the day Ram arrives early, he arrives at 5 pm and starts walking. Let's say he walks for t hours until he meets Sita. Then, they drive back home and arrive 30 minutes earlier than usual. So, the total time saved is 30 minutes. How does this happen?\n\nWait, the key here is that Sita left home at her usual time, which is 6 pm minus D/V. But since Ram arrived early, maybe she didn't have to drive all the way to the station? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that Sita arrives at the station by car to pick him up as soon as he arrives. So normally, she leaves home at a time that allows her to reach the station exactly when Ram arrives at 6 pm. So, her departure time is 6 pm minus (D/V). But on the day Ram arrives early, he starts walking at 5 pm. However, Sita still leaves home at her usual time, which is 6 pm minus (D/V). Therefore, she would have started driving towards the station at that time, expecting to meet Ram at 6 pm. But since Ram is already walking towards home, they meet somewhere along the way.\n\nSo, the time when Sita meets Ram is earlier than 6 pm. Let's denote the time when they meet as T_meet. Then, the time saved is 30 minutes, so the arrival time at home is 30 minutes earlier than usual. Normally, arrival time is 6 pm + D/V. On this day, arrival time is (6 pm + D/V) - 30 minutes. So, the total time from when they meet until arriving home is less than usual.\n\nWait, but when they meet, they drive back home. So, the time from meeting point to home is the distance from meeting point to home divided by Sita's speed. Let me think.\n\nLet me try to model this with equations. Let me define:\n\nLet’s assume that the distance from home to station is D. Sita's speed is V. So, normally, she takes D/V time to reach the station. So, she leaves home at 6 pm - D/V, arrives at 6 pm, picks up Ram, and they drive back home, arriving at 6 pm + D/V.\n\nOn the day Ram arrives early, he arrives at 5 pm and starts walking. Let’s say he walks for t hours until he meets Sita. Then, they drive back home and arrive 30 minutes earlier than usual. So, the arrival time is 6 pm + D/V - 30 minutes.\n\nBut when do they meet? Let's think about Sita's schedule. She leaves home at her usual time, which is 6 pm - D/V. So, on the day Ram arrives early, she still leaves home at 6 pm - D/V. Let’s denote that time as T_departure. So, T_departure = 6 pm - D/V.\n\nNow, from T_departure to the meeting time, Sita is driving towards the station. Let’s say the meeting happens at time T_meet. The duration from T_departure to T_meet is (T_meet - T_departure). In that time, Sita would have covered a distance of V*(T_meet - T_departure). But since she's driving towards the station, that distance is from home towards the station. However, Ram is walking from the station towards home, starting at 5 pm. So, the distance between them when Sita starts driving is D. But Ram starts walking at 5 pm, which is earlier than Sita's departure time. Wait, Sita's departure time is 6 pm - D/V. So, if D/V is, say, 30 minutes, then she leaves home at 5:30 pm. But Ram started walking at 5 pm. So, there's a time difference between when Ram starts walking and when Sita starts driving.\n\nWait, this is important. Let me think again. Let me denote the time it takes Sita to drive from home to station as T. So, T = D/V. Therefore, she leaves home at 6 pm - T, arrives at 6 pm. On the day Ram arrives early, he arrives at 5 pm and starts walking. But Sita still leaves home at 6 pm - T, as usual. Therefore, the time between when Ram starts walking (5 pm) and when Sita starts driving (6 pm - T) is (6 pm - T) - 5 pm = 1 hour - T. So, if T is, say, 30 minutes, then Sita leaves home at 5:30 pm, so Ram has been walking for 30 minutes before Sita even starts driving. But if T is longer than an hour, then Sita would leave home after 5 pm, but that might not make sense because she needs to reach the station by 6 pm. Wait, T is the time it takes her to drive from home to station. So, if she leaves home at 6 pm - T, then arrives at 6 pm. So, T must be less than an hour? Not necessarily. For example, if T is 1 hour, she leaves home at 5 pm, arrives at 6 pm. If T is 2 hours, she leaves home at 4 pm, arrives at 6 pm. But the problem says that Ram arrived one hour early, so maybe T is such that Sita's departure time is after 5 pm? Not sure. Let's not assume specific numbers yet.\n\nSo, Ram starts walking at 5 pm. Sita starts driving at 6 pm - T. The time between 5 pm and 6 pm - T is (6 pm - T) - 5 pm = 1 hour - T. If T is less than 1 hour, then this is positive, meaning Sita starts driving after Ram has already started walking. If T is more than 1 hour, then this is negative, meaning Sita starts driving before Ram starts walking. But since T is the time it takes her to drive from home to station, which is a fixed distance, it's possible that T could be more or less than an hour. However, given that Ram arrived an hour early and they saved 30 minutes, maybe T is something specific.\n\nBut perhaps instead of getting bogged down with T, I can use relative speeds. Let me think about the meeting point.\n\nLet’s denote that when they meet, Ram has been walking for t hours. But wait, he started walking at 5 pm, so the time from 5 pm to meeting time is t hours. However, Sita started driving at 6 pm - T, so the time she has been driving when they meet is (meeting time) - (6 pm - T). Let me denote meeting time as M. So, Ram's walking time is M - 5 pm. Sita's driving time is M - (6 pm - T).\n\nBut since they meet at the same point, the distance Ram has walked plus the distance Sita has driven equals the total distance D. So:\n\nDistance walked by Ram: V_r * (M - 5 pm)\n\nDistance driven by Sita: V * (M - (6 pm - T))\n\nBut wait, V_r is Ram's walking speed. However, the problem doesn't mention Ram's walking speed. Hmm, that might be a problem. Wait, but maybe we can relate it through the time saved.\n\nAlternatively, since they meet at some point, and then drive back home, arriving 30 minutes earlier. The total time saved is 30 minutes. How does that happen?\n\nNormally, they arrive home at 6 pm + T (since she takes T time to drive from home to station, then T time back). On the day they meet early, they arrive home 30 minutes earlier, so arrival time is 6 pm + T - 30 minutes.\n\nBut the arrival time on that day is also equal to the meeting time plus the time it takes to drive from meeting point to home. Let's denote the meeting point as being x distance from home. Then, the time to drive from meeting point to home is x / V. Therefore, arrival time is M + x / V = 6 pm + T - 30 minutes.\n\nBut also, the distance from home to meeting point is x, so the distance from meeting point to station is D - x. Since Ram walked from station to meeting point, the distance he walked is D - x. Therefore, D - x = V_r * (M - 5 pm). And Sita drove from home to meeting point, which is x = V * (M - (6 pm - T)).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx = V * [M - (6 pm - T)]\n\nand\n\nD - x = V_r * [M - 5 pm]\n\nBut we also know that normally, D = V * T, since she takes T time to drive from home to station. So, D = V*T.\n\nTherefore, substituting D = V*T into the second equation:\n\nV*T - x = V_r * [M - 5 pm]\n\nBut we also have x = V * [M - (6 pm - T)].\n\nSo, substituting x into the first equation:\n\nV*T - V*[M - (6 pm - T)] = V_r * [M - 5 pm]\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nV*T - V*M + V*(6 pm - T) = V_r * [M - 5 pm]\n\nSimplify:\n\nV*T - V*M + 6V pm - V*T = V_r * [M - 5 pm]\n\nThe V*T and -V*T cancel out:\n\n- V*M + 6V pm = V_r * [M - 5 pm]\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I need to express times in terms of hours or minutes. Let me convert all times to hours past a certain point to make it easier. Let's say 5 pm is time 0. Then 6 pm is 1 hour, and so on.\n\nLet me redefine:\n\nLet’s set 5 pm as time 0. Then:\n\n- Ram starts walking at time 0.\n\n- Sita leaves home at time (6 pm - T) - 5 pm = 1 hour - T. Wait, if T is the time it takes her to drive from home to station, which is D/V. But D = V*T, so T is D/V. Wait, this might not be helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, let me define T as the time it takes Sita to drive from home to station. So, normally, she leaves home at 6 pm - T, arrives at 6 pm. On the day Ram arrives early, she still leaves home at 6 pm - T. Let me express all times in hours relative to 5 pm.\n\nSo, 5 pm is time 0.\n\nThen, 6 pm is time 1.\n\nSita leaves home at time (1 - T) hours (since 6 pm - T is 1 hour - T hours after 5 pm).\n\nRam starts walking at time 0.\n\nThey meet at some time t (in hours after 5 pm). So, Ram has been walking for t hours. Sita has been driving for (t - (1 - T)) hours, but only if t >= (1 - T). If t < (1 - T), then Sita hasn't even started driving yet. But since they meet, Sita must have started driving before meeting time. Therefore, t >= (1 - T). So, Sita's driving time is t - (1 - T) = t + T - 1 hours.\n\nThe distance Ram has walked is V_r * t.\n\nThe distance Sita has driven is V * (t + T - 1).\n\nSince they meet, the sum of these distances is D, the total distance from home to station:\n\nV_r * t + V * (t + T - 1) = D.\n\nBut D is also equal to V*T, since normally she drives from home to station in T hours. Therefore:\n\nV_r * t + V*(t + T - 1) = V*T\n\nSimplify:\n\nV_r * t + V*t + V*T - V = V*T\n\nSubtract V*T from both sides:\n\nV_r * t + V*t - V = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nt*(V_r + V) = V\n\nTherefore:\n\nt = V / (V_r + V)\n\nHmm, interesting. But this seems to relate t to the speeds of Ram and Sita. However, we don't know V_r or V. But maybe we can find another equation from the time saved.\n\nAfter meeting, they drive back home. The time to drive back home is the distance from meeting point to home divided by V. The distance from meeting point to home is the distance Sita has driven, which is V*(t + T - 1). Therefore, the time to drive back is [V*(t + T - 1)] / V = t + T - 1 hours.\n\nTherefore, the arrival time at home is meeting time t plus driving time t + T - 1:\n\nArrival time = t + t + T - 1 = 2t + T - 1 hours after 5 pm.\n\nNormally, arrival time is 6 pm + T, which is 1 + T hours after 5 pm. On this day, arrival time is 2t + T - 1 hours after 5 pm, and this is 30 minutes (0.5 hours) earlier than usual. Therefore:\n\n2t + T - 1 = (1 + T) - 0.5\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n1 + T - 0.5 = T + 0.5\n\nSo:\n\n2t + T - 1 = T + 0.5\n\nSubtract T from both sides:\n\n2t - 1 = 0.5\n\nAdd 1:\n\n2t = 1.5\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nt = 0.75 hours = 45 minutes.\n\nSo, Ram has been walking for 45 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 45 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Let me verify with an example.\n\nSuppose Sita's driving time T is, say, 1 hour. So normally, she leaves home at 6 pm - 1 hour = 5 pm, arrives at 6 pm. On the day Ram arrives early, he starts walking at 5 pm. Sita still leaves home at 5 pm. So, they both start moving towards each other at 5 pm. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, t = 0.75 hours = 45 minutes. So, they meet at 5:45 pm. Then, the distance from meeting point to home is Sita's driving distance: V*(t + T - 1) = V*(0.75 + 1 - 1) = V*0.75. So, driving back takes 0.75 hours, arriving at 5:45 + 0.75 hours = 6:45 pm. Normally, arrival time is 6 pm + 1 hour = 7 pm. So, 6:45 pm is 15 minutes earlier, not 30. Wait, that contradicts the given 30 minutes earlier. So, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, in this example, T = 1 hour. According to our calculation, t = 0.75 hours. But according to the arrival time, it's 2t + T - 1 = 2*0.75 + 1 - 1 = 1.5 hours after 5 pm, which is 6:30 pm. Normally, arrival time is 1 + T = 1 + 1 = 2 hours after 5 pm, which is 7 pm. So, 6:30 pm is 30 minutes earlier. Oh, I miscalculated earlier. So, arrival time is 5:45 pm + driving time. Wait, driving time is t + T - 1 = 0.75 + 1 - 1 = 0.75 hours. So, arrival time is 5:45 pm + 0.75 hours = 6:30 pm, which is 30 minutes earlier than 7 pm. That works. So, in this case, t = 45 minutes, which is the answer. So, even though in this example, Sita left home at the same time Ram started walking, they met after 45 minutes, and arrived home 30 minutes early. So, that seems to check out.\n\nBut let me try another example. Suppose T = 30 minutes (0.5 hours). Then normally, Sita leaves home at 6 pm - 0.5 hours = 5:30 pm, arrives at 6 pm. On the day Ram arrives early, he starts walking at 5 pm. Sita leaves home at 5:30 pm. So, from 5 pm to 5:30 pm, Ram is walking alone for 30 minutes. Then, from 5:30 pm onwards, both are moving towards each other.\n\nAccording to our formula, t = 0.75 hours = 45 minutes. So, meeting time is 5 pm + 45 minutes = 5:45 pm. Sita started driving at 5:30 pm, so she has been driving for 15 minutes (0.25 hours) when they meet. The distance she has driven is V * 0.25. The distance Ram has walked is V_r * 0.75. The total distance D = V*T = V*0.5. So:\n\nV_r * 0.75 + V * 0.25 = V * 0.5\n\nTherefore:\n\nV_r * 0.75 = V * 0.25\n\nSo, V_r = (V * 0.25)/0.75 = V/3. So, Ram's walking speed is 1/3 of Sita's driving speed. That seems plausible.\n\nThen, after meeting at 5:45 pm, they drive back home. The distance from meeting point to home is the distance Sita has driven, which is V * 0.25. So, driving time is 0.25 hours, arriving at 5:45 pm + 0.25 hours = 6:00 pm. Normally, arrival time is 6 pm + 0.5 hours = 6:30 pm. So, they arrived 30 minutes earlier. That works. So, in this case, Ram walked for 45 minutes. So, the answer seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, regardless of T, the answer is 45 minutes. The key was that the time saved is 30 minutes, which relates to the difference in arrival times, and through the equations, we found that t = 0.75 hours, which is 45 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 45 minutes.\n</think>\n\nRam has been walking for **45 minutes**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Usual Scenario:**  \n   - Ram arrives at the station at 6:00 PM.  \n   - Sita leaves home at **6:00 PM - T**, where **T** is the time it takes her to drive from home to the station (i.e., $ D/V $, where $ D $ is the distance and $ V $ is her driving speed).  \n   - They drive back home, arriving at **6:00 PM + T**.\n\n2. **Early Arrival Scenario:**  \n   - Ram arrives at 5:00 PM and starts walking.  \n   - Sita still leaves home at **6:00 PM - T** (her usual time).  \n   - They meet at some point, then drive back home, arriving **30 minutes earlier** than usual (i.e., at **6:00 PM + T - 0.5 hours**).\n\n3. **Key Equations:**  \n   - Let $ t $ be the time Ram walks (in hours) until meeting Sita.  \n   - Sita drives for $ t + T - 1 $ hours (since she starts at 6:00 PM - T, which is 1 hour - T after 5:00 PM).  \n   - The distance Ram walks: $ V_r \\cdot t $ (where $ V_r $ is his walking speed).  \n   - The distance Sita drives: $ V \\cdot (t + T - 1) $.  \n   - Total distance $ D = V \\cdot T $, so:  \n     $$\n     V_r \\cdot t + V \\cdot (t + T - 1) = V \\cdot T\n     $$\n     Simplifying:  \n     $$\n     t(V_r + V) = V \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     $$\n\n4. **Arrival Time Calculation:**  \n   - After meeting, they drive back home. The time to drive back is $ \\frac{V \\cdot (t + T - 1)}{V} = t + T - 1 $ hours.  \n   - Total arrival time: $ t + (t + T - 1) = 2t + T - 1 $.  \n   - This equals the usual arrival time minus 0.5 hours:  \n     $$\n     2t + T - 1 = (1 + T) - 0.5\n     $$\n     Simplifying:  \n     $$\n     2t = 1.5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = 0.75 \\, \\text{hours} = 45 \\, \\text{minutes}\n     $$\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRam walked for **45 minutes** before meeting Sita. This result is independent of the driving speed or distance, as the time saved (30 minutes) directly determines the walking duration.",
