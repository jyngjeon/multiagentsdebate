    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the setup is that 85% of the taxis in the city are green, and the remaining 15% are blue. There's a witness who saw a taxi and said it was blue. The witness is usually correct 80% of the time. The question is asking: what's the probability that the taxi actually is blue, given that the witness said it was blue?\n\nHmm, this sounds like a classic case of conditional probability. Maybe I need to use Bayes' Theorem here. Let me recall Bayes' Theorem. It states that the probability of an event A given that B occurred is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. So, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B).\n\nIn this case, event A is \"the taxi is blue,\" and event B is \"the witness says it's blue.\" So, we need to find P(Blue | Witness says Blue).\n\nFirst, let's note down the given probabilities. The prior probability that a taxi is blue is 15%, or 0.15. The prior probability that a taxi is green is 85%, or 0.85. The witness is correct 80% of the time, so if the taxi is actually blue, the witness will correctly identify it as blue 80% of the time. Conversely, if the taxi is green, the witness will incorrectly say it's blue 20% of the time, right? Because the witness is wrong 20% of the time.\n\nSo, applying Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(Blue | Witness says Blue) = [P(Witness says Blue | Blue) * P(Blue)] / P(Witness says Blue)\n\nWe know P(Witness says Blue | Blue) is 0.8, and P(Blue) is 0.15. Now, we need to find P(Witness says Blue), which is the total probability that the witness says Blue, regardless of the actual color. This can be calculated by considering both possibilities: the taxi is blue and the witness is correct, or the taxi is green and the witness is incorrect.\n\nSo, P(Witness says Blue) = P(Witness says Blue | Blue) * P(Blue) + P(Witness says Blue | Green) * P(Green)\n\nWe already have P(Witness says Blue | Blue) = 0.8 and P(Blue) = 0.15. Then, P(Witness says Blue | Green) is the probability that the witness is wrong when the taxi is green, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. And P(Green) is 0.85.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(Witness says Blue) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\n\nTherefore, P(Blue | Witness says Blue) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138, or about 41.38%.\n\nWait, that seems low. Even though the witness is 80% accurate, the base rate of blue taxis is only 15%, so even with a correct witness, the probability isn't that high. Because there are more green taxis, so even if the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the number of false positives (green taxis misidentified as blue) might be higher than the true positives (blue taxis correctly identified as blue). Let me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal probability of witness saying blue: 0.8*0.15 (true positives) + 0.2*0.85 (false positives) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. So, out of 0.29 cases where the witness says blue, 0.12 are actual blues. So 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138. Yeah, that seems right. So the probability is roughly 41.4%.\n\nBut let me think again. If the witness is 80% accurate, then when she says blue, there's an 80% chance she's right? Wait, no. That's not how it works. Because the base rate affects it. So even if she's 80% accurate, the actual probability depends on the prior probabilities. So in this case, since blue taxis are less common, even with a correct witness, the probability isn't as high as 80%. It's lower because the base rate of blue is low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of numbers. Suppose there are 1000 taxis. 850 are green, 150 are blue. The witness sees a taxi. Let's say she sees 1000 taxis. She is correct 80% of the time. So, for the 150 blue taxis, she correctly identifies 80% of them as blue: 150 * 0.8 = 120. For the 850 green taxis, she incorrectly identifies 20% as blue: 850 * 0.2 = 170. So total number of times she says blue is 120 + 170 = 290. Out of these 290, 120 are actual blue. So 120 / 290 ≈ 0.4138, same as before. So that's 41.38%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 41.4%, which is 12/29 as a fraction. So 12 divided by 29 is approximately 0.4138.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the witness sees a blue taxi. She is usually correct with a probability of 80%.\" Wait, is that the same as saying that the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the color? So if the taxi is blue, she says blue with 80% chance, and if it's green, she says green with 80% chance. So that's the same as the accuracy rate. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me check again. The problem says: \"A witness sees a blue taxi. She is usually correct with a probability of 80%.\" Wait, does that mean that when she sees a taxi, she is correct 80% of the time? So regardless of the color, her accuracy is 80%. So that would be the same as saying that P(witness says correct color | actual color) is 80%. So that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the witness saw a taxi and said it was blue. So the question is, given that the witness said blue, what's the probability that it's actually blue. Which is exactly the same as the problem I solved. So the answer is 12/29 ≈ 41.4%.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the witness's accuracy. Let me think again. If the witness is correct 80% of the time, that could be interpreted as P(witness says correct color | actual color) = 0.8. So for any actual color, the witness has an 80% chance of reporting it correctly. So if the actual color is blue, she says blue with 80% chance, and green with 20% chance. If the actual color is green, she says green with 80% chance, and blue with 20% chance. So that's the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is approximately 41.4%, which is 12/29. So 12 divided by 29 is approximately 0.4138, so 41.38%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented differently. Wait, the original problem says \"A witness sees a blue taxi. She is usually correct with a probability of 80%.\" Wait, does that mean that the witness saw a blue taxi, and she is correct 80% of the time? Or is it that the witness is correct 80% of the time in general?\n\nI think the correct interpretation is that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in general. So regardless of the color, when she sees a taxi, she correctly identifies its color 80% of the time. Therefore, the calculation as before applies.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the taxi is blue, but that's not what it says. It says \"She is usually correct with a probability of 80%.\" So that's a general accuracy rate.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 12/29, which is approximately 41.4%. So the probability that the taxi is actually blue, given that the witness said it was blue, is about 41.4%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the taxi is actually blue, given that the witness reported it as blue, is calculated using **Bayes' Theorem**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Given:**\n- **Prior probabilities:**\n  - P(Blue) = 15% = 0.15  \n  - P(Green) = 85% = 0.85  \n- **Witness accuracy:**\n  - P(Witness says Blue | Blue) = 80% = 0.8  \n  - P(Witness says Green | Green) = 80% = 0.8  \n  - Therefore, P(Witness says Blue | Green) = 20% = 0.2  \n\n### **Step 1: Compute P(Witness says Blue)**\nThis is the total probability that the witness says \"blue,\" considering both true and false positives:\n$$\nP(\\text{Witness says Blue}) = P(\\text{Witness says Blue} | \\text{Blue}) \\cdot P(\\text{Blue}) + P(\\text{Witness says Blue} | \\text{Green}) \\cdot P(\\text{Green})\n$$\n$$\n= (0.8 \\cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \\cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\n$$\n\n### **Step 2: Apply Bayes' Theorem**\n$$\nP(\\text{Blue} | \\text{Witness says Blue}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Witness says Blue} | \\text{Blue}) \\cdot P(\\text{Blue})}{P(\\text{Witness says Blue})}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{0.8 \\cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \\frac{0.12}{0.29} \\approx 0.4138\n$$\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n$$\n\\boxed{41.4\\%}\n$$\n\n### **Explanation:**\nEven though the witness is 80% accurate, the **low base rate of blue taxis (15%)** means that **false positives (green taxis misidentified as blue)** outnumber **true positives (blue taxis correctly identified)**. This results in a **posterior probability of ~41.4%** that the taxi is actually blue, despite the witness's report.",

    "explanation": "Out of all the taxis in the city, 85% are green and the remaining 15% are blue. The witness sees a blue taxi. There are two possibilities: either she saw a blue taxi and identified it correctly, or she saw a green taxi and misidentified it as blue.  The probability of seeing a blue taxi and identifying it correctly is (15% * 80%) = 12%. The probability of seeing a green taxi and misidentifying it as blue is (85% * 20%) = 17%.
