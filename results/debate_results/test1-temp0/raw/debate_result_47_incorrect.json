    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about a man in a 50-meter deep well. Each day, he climbs up 4 meters but then slips back 3 meters. The question is, how many days will it take him to get out of the well?\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out the net progress he makes each day. If he climbs 4 meters and slips 3 meters, that's a net gain of 1 meter per day. But wait, that might not be the whole story. Because once he gets close to the top, he might not slip back anymore. For example, if he's within 4 meters of the top, he could climb out without slipping back. So maybe the last day is different.\n\nLet me think. Let's break it down. Each day, he effectively gains 1 meter. But on the final day, when he reaches or exceeds the 50 meters, he doesn't slip back. So maybe we need to calculate how many days it takes for him to get to a point where he can climb out in one go.\n\nSo, if the well is 50 meters deep, and each day he makes a net gain of 1 meter, but on the last day he doesn't slip. So, let's say he needs to reach 46 meters. Because from 46 meters, climbing 4 meters would get him to 50 meters, and he's out. So, how many days to get to 46 meters?\n\nIf each day he gains 1 meter, then 46 meters would take 46 days. Then on the 47th day, he climbs 4 meters and gets out. So the answer would be 47 days?\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose the well is 4 meters deep. Then he climbs 4 meters in one day and gets out. So that's 1 day. If the well is 5 meters deep. On day 1, he climbs to 4, slips to 1. Day 2, climbs to 5, gets out. So that's 2 days. So the formula is (depth - climb) / net gain per day + 1 day?\n\nWait, in the 5m example, (5 - 4)/1 +1 = 1 +1 = 2 days. That works. For 4m, (4-4)/1 +1 = 0 +1 =1 day. That works. So applying that formula to 50m: (50 -4)/1 +1 = 46 +1 =47 days. So that seems to check out.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose the well is 1 meter deep. Then he climbs 4 meters, but the well is only 1m. So he would get out on the first day. But according to the formula, (1-4)/1 +1 would be negative, which doesn't make sense. But in reality, if the well is less than 4 meters, he can just climb out in one day. So maybe the formula is: if the depth is less than or equal to 4 meters, it's 1 day. Otherwise, (depth -4)/1 +1 days. Wait, but (depth - climb) is (depth -4). So for depth 50, (50-4)=46, then +1 day. So 47 days. That seems to work.\n\nAnother example: 8 meters. Let's simulate. Day 1: climbs to 4, slips to 1. Day 2: climbs to 5, slips to 2. Day 3: climbs to 6, slips to 3. Day 4: climbs to 7, slips to 4. Day 5: climbs to 8, gets out. So that's 5 days. According to the formula: (8-4)/1 +1 =4 +1=5. Correct. So that works.\n\nSo applying this to 50 meters, the answer would be 47 days. But let me check another way. Each day, he gains 1 meter, except the last day. So the total distance he needs to cover before the last day is 50 -4 =46 meters. Since each day he gains 1 meter, that would take 46 days. Then on day 47, he climbs 4 meters and gets out. So yes, 47 days.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: suppose he is at 46 meters on day 46. Then on day 47, he climbs 4 meters to 50, and is out. So that's 47 days. So that seems correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there isn't a miscalculation here. Let me think again. Suppose the well is 50 meters. Each day, he climbs 4, slips 3. So net 1 per day. But on the day he reaches or exceeds 50, he doesn't slip. So the key is that once he reaches the top, he's done. So the problem is similar to the classic \"snail climbing out of a well\" problem.\n\nIn the classic problem, the answer is (depth - climb) / net gain +1. So here, depth is 50, climb is 4, net gain is 1. So (50-4)/1 +1 =47. So that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check with another example. If the well is 2 meters deep. He can climb out in 1 day. If it's 3 meters, same. If it's 4 meters, 1 day. If it's 5 meters, 2 days. So the formula works. So yes, 47 days.\n</think>\n\nThe man will take **47 days** to escape the well. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Net Progress Per Day**: Each day, he climbs 4 meters and slips back 3 meters, resulting in a **net gain of 1 meter per day**. However, on the final day, once he reaches or exceeds the top, he **does not slip back**.\n\n2. **Critical Threshold**: To avoid slipping on the last day, he must reach a point where climbing 4 meters will get him out. This means he needs to reach **46 meters** (since 46 + 4 = 50 meters). \n\n3. **Days to Reach 46 Meters**: At a net gain of 1 meter per day, it takes **46 days** to reach 46 meters.\n\n4. **Final Day**: On the **47th day**, he climbs 4 meters from 46 meters to escape the well without slipping back.\n\n**Answer**: **47 days**.",

    "explanation": "On the first day, the man climbs 4 meters up and slips 3 meters down, therefore he only climbs 1 meter up totally.\nOn the second day, again he climbs 1 meter up, so the total distance climbed is 2 meters till the second day.
