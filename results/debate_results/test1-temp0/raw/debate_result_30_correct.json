    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the probability that the 100th person ends up in their assigned seat when the first person sits randomly and everyone else follows the rule of sitting in their own seat if available, otherwise choosing randomly. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the problem. There are 100 seats and 100 people. Each person has an assigned seat. The first person loses their boarding pass and picks a seat at random. Then each subsequent person, if their seat is available, they take it; if not, they pick a random seat from the remaining ones. The question is, what's the chance that the last person (person 100) gets their own seat?\n\nI remember hearing something about this problem before. I think the answer is 1/2, but I need to verify that. Let me try to work through smaller cases to see if that holds.\n\nLet's start with a smaller number of people, say 2 people. If there are 2 seats and 2 people. The first person (person 1) picks a seat at random. There's a 50% chance they pick their own seat (seat 1), and 50% chance they pick seat 2. If they pick seat 1, then person 2 gets their seat. If person 1 picks seat 2, then person 2 can't sit in their seat and has to take the remaining seat, which is seat 1. So the probability that person 2 gets their seat is 1/2. That matches the 1/2 idea.\n\nWhat about 3 people? Let's see. Person 1 picks randomly between seats 1, 2, 3.\n\nCase 1: Person 1 picks seat 1 (probability 1/3). Then everyone else takes their own seat, so person 3 gets their seat.\n\nCase 2: Person 1 picks seat 2 (probability 1/3). Then person 2 comes in, finds their seat taken, so they have to choose randomly between the remaining seats. At this point, seats 1 and 3 are available. Person 2 picks randomly. If they pick seat 1, then person 3 can take seat 3. If they pick seat 3, then person 3 can't. So the probability here is 1/2. So overall for this case, the probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nCase 3: Person 1 picks seat 3 (probability 1/3). Then person 2 comes in, their seat (seat 2) is available, so they take it. Then person 3 comes in and finds their seat taken by person 1. So person 3 can't sit in their seat. So this case contributes 0.\n\nSo total probability is 1/3 (from case 1) + 1/6 (from case 2) = 1/2. Again, 1/2. Interesting. So with 3 people, the probability is also 1/2.\n\nWait, so maybe for any number of people, the probability is 1/2? That seems surprising, but the small cases support it. Let me check with 4 people to be sure.\n\nFor 4 people. Person 1 picks randomly among seats 1-4.\n\nCase 1: Person 1 picks seat 1 (prob 1/4). Then everyone else takes their own seat. Person 4 gets their seat.\n\nCase 2: Person 1 picks seat 4 (prob 1/4). Then person 2, 3 take their seats, person 4 can't. So 0.\n\nCase 3: Person 1 picks seat 2 (prob 1/4). Then person 2 comes in, seat taken. They have to choose randomly from seats 1, 3, 4. Let's think about this. If person 2 picks seat 1, then the rest can take their seats, so person 4 gets theirs. If person 2 picks seat 3, then person 3 will have their seat taken and have to choose randomly between seats 1 and 4. Then person 3 would pick randomly, leading to a 50% chance for person 4. If person 2 picks seat 4, then person 4 can't sit. So the probability here is:\n\nProbability person 2 picks seat 1: 1/3 → person 4 gets seat.\n\nProbability person 2 picks seat 3: 1/3 → then person 3 has to choose between 1 and 4. Then person 3 picks randomly, so 1/2 chance for person 4.\n\nProbability person 2 picks seat 4: 1/3 → person 4 can't.\n\nSo total probability for this case is (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(1/2) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2. Then multiply by the probability of case 3 (1/4) gives 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nCase 4: Person 1 picks seat 3 (prob 1/4). Then person 2 takes their seat. Person 3 comes in, seat taken. They have to choose randomly from seats 1, 2, 4. Wait, seat 2 is already taken by person 2? No, person 2 took their own seat. So seats available are 1, 4. Wait, person 1 took seat 3, person 2 took seat 2. So when person 3 comes, their seat is taken, so they choose randomly between seats 1 and 4. Then person 3 picks seat 1 or 4. If they pick seat 1, then person 4 can take seat 4. If they pick seat 4, then person 4 can't. So probability here is 1/2. Multiply by 1/4 (prob of case 4) gives 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nSo total probability is case1 (1/4) + case3 (1/8) + case4 (1/8) = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/2. Again, 1/2. Wow, so with 4 people, it's also 1/2. So maybe this pattern holds for any number of people. Therefore, the answer is 1/2.\n\nBut why? What's the general reasoning here?\n\nI think the key is that when the first person takes a seat, they either take their own seat, the last person's seat, or someone else's. If they take their own seat, everything is fine. If they take the last person's seat, then the last person can't sit. If they take someone else's seat, say person k's seat, then person k will face the same problem when it's their turn. This seems recursive.\n\nSo the problem reduces to a situation where the first person is essentially choosing between their own seat and the last person's seat, with all other choices deferring the problem to a smaller version of the same problem. Therefore, the probability ends up being 1/2.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the first person's choice creates a conflict between seat 1 and seat 100. Every time someone is displaced, they choose randomly, which could either resolve the conflict by choosing seat 1 or seat 100, or pass the problem on. Eventually, when there are only two seats left, it's a 50-50 chance between seat 1 and seat 100. Hence, the probability is 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, there's a mathematical proof that the probability is always 1/2 regardless of the number of passengers. The key idea is that the first person's choice starts a chain of displacements, and the only way the last person doesn't get their seat is if someone before them took it. But due to the symmetry between the first and the last seat, the probability ends up being 1/2.\n\nSo, after checking small cases and considering the recursive nature of the problem, I think the probability is indeed 1/2.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the 100th person ends up in their assigned seat is **1/2** (or 50%). Here's the reasoning:\n\n### Key Insight:\nThe problem reduces to a recursive conflict between the first person's choice and the last person's seat. When the first person randomly selects a seat, they either:\n1. **Choose their own seat (seat 1)**: Everyone else sits in their assigned seat, including the 100th person.  \n2. **Choose the 100th person's seat (seat 100)**: The 100th person cannot sit in their seat.  \n3. **Choose someone else's seat (seat *k*, where 2 ≤ *k* ≤ 99)**: This displaces person *k*, who then faces the same dilemma when it's their turn. This creates a recursive subproblem with fewer passengers.\n\n### Recursive Symmetry:\nAt every step, the displaced person acts as a \"new\" first person, perpetuating the conflict between seat 1 and seat 100. The process continues until only two seats remain: seat 1 and seat 100. At this point, the last remaining person (who could be the 100th person or someone else) has a **50% chance** of choosing either seat. This symmetry ensures the final probability is always **1/2**, regardless of the number of passengers.\n\n### Verification with Small Cases:\n- **2 people**: 1/2 chance the 2nd person gets their seat.  \n- **3 people**: 1/2 chance the 3rd person gets their seat.  \n- **4 people**: 1/2 chance the 4th person gets their seat.  \nThis pattern holds for any number of passengers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe probability that the 100th person sits in their assigned seat is **1/2**.",

The other one of those two seats has taken by someone else. They must have picked it at random, so it's equally likely to be either of the two. For anyone who has a chance of sitting in either the first or the last seat, both are available and equally likely, since picking either means everyone else (before the 100th) can take their assigned seat.",
