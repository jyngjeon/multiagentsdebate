    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of airplanes required to get one plane all the way around the world, with all the planes returning safely. Let me start by understanding the problem again.\n\nEach plane can fly exactly half the distance around the world. So, if the full circle is 1 unit, each plane can go 0.5 units on a full tank. They can refuel in flight without any loss, and the only place to get fuel is the island. The goal is to have one plane make the full trip, while all others return safely. The challenge is to minimize the number of planes needed.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is a classic puzzle, often referred to as the \"around the world in a day\" problem or something similar. But I need to work through it step by step.\n\nLet me think about how fuel works. Since each plane can carry enough fuel to go 1/2 the distance, but they can transfer fuel mid-air. So, if two planes take off together, they can share fuel. For example, if two planes fly together for a certain distance, then one can transfer some fuel to the other and return. The key is to calculate how much fuel can be transferred and how far the planes can go with that.\n\nLet me consider the simplest case. If only one plane is used, it can only go halfway, so that's not enough. So we need more planes.\n\nIf two planes go together. Let's say they both take off, and fly for a certain distance. Let's say they fly x distance. At that point, each has used x fuel. If they transfer fuel, how much can they transfer?\n\nWait, each plane can carry fuel for 0.5 units. So, if they fly x distance, they have 0.5 - x fuel left. If they transfer fuel, the total fuel available is 2*(0.5 - x). But one plane needs to return, so it needs to have enough fuel to go back x distance. So, the returning plane needs x fuel. Therefore, the other plane can take the remaining fuel.\n\nSo, the total fuel available is 2*(0.5 - x). Subtract the fuel needed for the returning plane: 2*(0.5 - x) - x = 1 - 2x - x = 1 - 3x. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me rephrase.\n\nEach plane starts with 0.5 fuel. After flying x distance, each has 0.5 - x fuel. If one plane gives fuel to the other, the giving plane needs to have enough fuel to return. So, the giving plane must have at least x fuel to return. Therefore, the amount of fuel it can give is (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x. Wait, that can't be right. If the giving plane has 0.5 - x fuel after flying x, and needs to have x fuel to return, then the maximum it can give is (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x. But this must be non-negative, so 0.5 - 2x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 0.25.\n\nSo, if x is 0.25, then the giving plane can transfer 0.5 - 2*(0.25) = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0. So that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose two planes take off together. They fly together for x distance. Each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x fuel left. Now, one plane (say, Plane A) needs to return. To return, it needs to have enough fuel to go back x distance. So, Plane A must have at least x fuel. Therefore, the amount of fuel Plane A can give to Plane B is (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x. But this must be ≥ 0, so x ≤ 0.25. Therefore, if x is 0.25, Plane A can give 0.5 - 2*(0.25) = 0. So no fuel is transferred. That doesn't help. If x is less than 0.25, then Plane A can give some fuel to Plane B.\n\nWait, but if x is 0.2, then Plane A can give 0.5 - 2*0.2 = 0.1 fuel to Plane B. Then Plane B would have its original 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3 fuel plus 0.1, totaling 0.4 fuel. Then Plane B can continue flying. How far can it go? It has 0.4 fuel, which would allow it to go 0.4 distance. But since it already flew 0.2, it can go another 0.4, totaling 0.6, which is more than half the world. Wait, but the total distance is 1, so half is 0.5. So 0.6 would be beyond half. But the problem is that Plane B needs to go all the way around, which is 1. So even if it gets 0.4 more fuel, it can only go 0.4 more, so total 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6, which is still not enough. So even with two planes, this approach doesn't get Plane B to the full distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiple planes are needed to transfer fuel at different points. Let me think about using more planes.\n\nThis problem is similar to the classic camel and bananas problem, where you have to make multiple trips to transfer resources. In this case, the resource is fuel, and the planes can act as fuel depots.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of fuel depots. If you have multiple planes, they can fly out, transfer fuel, and return, thereby leaving fuel at certain points which can be used by other planes.\n\nFor example, if you have three planes. Let me try to outline a possible strategy.\n\nFirst, all three planes take off together. They fly a certain distance, then some planes transfer fuel to others and return, while others continue.\n\nBut I need to calculate the exact distances and fuel transfers.\n\nLet me consider the general approach. To get a plane to go beyond 0.5, you need to have fuel transferred from other planes. Each time a plane helps another, it can transfer some fuel but must return, so the fuel it can transfer is limited by the distance it needs to go back.\n\nLet me think of the problem in segments. Suppose we divide the journey into segments where planes can meet and transfer fuel.\n\nLet me try with three planes. Let's say all three take off together. They fly for a distance x. At this point, each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left.\n\nNow, two planes (Plane 2 and Plane 3) can transfer fuel to Plane 1 and then return. How much fuel can they transfer?\n\nEach of Plane 2 and Plane 3 needs to have enough fuel to return to the island. So, they need to have x fuel each to return. Therefore, the amount of fuel they can transfer is (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x per plane.\n\nSo, total fuel transferred to Plane 1 would be 2*(0.5 - 2x). Plane 1 already has 0.5 - x fuel. So total fuel Plane 1 has is 0.5 - x + 2*(0.5 - 2x) = 0.5 - x + 1 - 4x = 1.5 - 5x.\n\nPlane 1 needs to have enough fuel to go the rest of the way. The total distance is 1, so after flying x, it needs to go 1 - x. The fuel required is 1 - x. Therefore, 1.5 - 5x ≥ 1 - x → 1.5 - 5x ≥ 1 - x → 0.5 ≥ 4x → x ≤ 0.125.\n\nSo, if x is 0.125, then Plane 1 has 1.5 - 5*(0.125) = 1.5 - 0.625 = 0.875 fuel. The distance remaining is 1 - 0.125 = 0.875. So Plane 1 can just make it. Wait, that seems to work. But then, what about the other planes?\n\nPlane 2 and Plane 3 each have 0.5 - x = 0.5 - 0.125 = 0.375 fuel. They need to return, which requires x = 0.125 fuel. So they can transfer 0.375 - 0.125 = 0.25 fuel each to Plane 1. So total transferred is 0.5, which added to Plane 1's original 0.5 - 0.125 = 0.375 gives 0.375 + 0.5 = 0.875, which is exactly the fuel needed to go 0.875 distance. So that works.\n\nBut wait, in this case, Plane 1 can go all the way around? Wait, no. Because the total distance is 1. If Plane 1 has 0.875 fuel, which allows it to fly 0.875 distance. But it already flew 0.125, so total distance would be 0.125 + 0.875 = 1.0. So yes, that works. But then, all planes return safely. Plane 1 goes all the way, and Planes 2 and 3 return with their remaining fuel. Wait, but Plane 1 is going all the way, so it can't return. Wait, the problem says that all planes must return safely. So Plane 1 is the one that goes all the way around, but the others must return. Wait, but in this scenario, Plane 1 is going all the way, but how does it return? Wait, no, the problem says that the one plane must go all the way around, and all others must return. So Plane 1 is the one that goes around, but in this case, Plane 1 would have just enough fuel to go from the 0.125 point to the end, but then it can't return. Wait, but the problem says that all planes must return. So Plane 1 is the one that goes around, but it must return as well? Wait, no, the problem says \"get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport.\" So the one plane that goes around must return? Or does it just need to go around, and the others return?\n\nWait, the wording is: \"get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport.\" So the one plane that goes around must return as well? Or does it just need to complete the trip, and the others return? Wait, the wording is ambiguous, but in the classic problem, the plane that goes around the world does not need to return, but all the other planes must return. However, the problem here says \"all of the air planes must return safely to the airport.\" So that would mean that even the one that goes around must return. Wait, that complicates things. Because if the plane that goes around must return, then it needs to have enough fuel to go around the world and then return, which would be 2 units of distance. But each plane can only carry 0.5 units. So that seems impossible. Therefore, maybe the problem is that the one plane needs to go around the world (i.e., complete the full circle), and all other planes must return. So the one plane doesn't need to return, but the others do. That makes more sense. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo, assuming that the one plane that goes around doesn't need to return, but all others must. So in that case, the previous calculation where Plane 1 goes from 0.125 to 1.0 (distance 0.875) with 0.875 fuel is correct. Then, Planes 2 and 3 return with their remaining fuel. Wait, but in that case, Plane 1 is going all the way around, but how does it get back? Wait, no, the problem says \"get one air plane all the way around the world\", so maybe it's allowed to not return. But the problem says \"all of the air planes must return safely to the airport.\" So that would include the one that went around. Therefore, that seems contradictory. Unless the one plane that goes around is allowed to not return, but the problem says all must return. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nLet me check again: \"What is the minimum number of air-planes required to get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport?\"\n\nSo, the one plane that goes around must return as well. Therefore, the total distance for that plane is 1 (around the world) plus returning, which is 2. But each plane can only carry 0.5 fuel. Therefore, this seems impossible unless there's a way to refuel multiple times. But the problem says that the island is the only source of fuel. So the planes can only get fuel from the island. Therefore, the only way for the plane to go around the world and return is to have enough fuel to do so, but since each plane can only carry 0.5, which is half the distance, it's impossible unless other planes help it refuel mid-flight.\n\nWait, but if the plane can be refueled multiple times by other planes, then maybe it's possible. But the problem is that all planes must return. So the helper planes must also return. Therefore, the problem is similar to the classic problem where you have to get a plane around the world with multiple planes helping and returning.\n\nIn the classic problem, the answer is 3 planes. But I need to verify that.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the one plane needs to go around the world (distance 1) and return (another 1), but that's 2 units. However, the planes can only carry 0.5 units. So the total fuel needed for the plane to go around and return is 2 units. But since the island is the only source, the plane can't carry that much. Therefore, other planes must transfer fuel to it during the trip.\n\nBut the problem is that all planes must return. So the helper planes can't just stay out there; they have to return. Therefore, the fuel they transfer to the main plane must be done in such a way that they can return.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of multiple trips where planes can meet and transfer fuel. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me consider the classic solution. In the classic problem where a plane needs to go around the world with the help of other planes, the minimum number is 3. But I need to check the exact steps.\n\nLet me try with 3 planes. Let's say all three take off together. They fly for a certain distance, then some planes transfer fuel and return, while others continue.\n\nLet me think in terms of fuel transfer points. Suppose we have three planes: A, B, and C. All take off together. They fly for a distance x. At this point, each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left.\n\nNow, planes B and C can transfer fuel to A and then return. To return, they need to have enough fuel to go back x distance. So each of B and C needs to have x fuel. Therefore, the amount they can transfer is (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x per plane.\n\nSo total fuel transferred to A is 2*(0.5 - 2x). Plane A now has its original 0.5 - x plus the transferred fuel: 0.5 - x + 2*(0.5 - 2x) = 0.5 - x + 1 - 4x = 1.5 - 5x.\n\nPlane A needs to have enough fuel to go the rest of the way around the world and then return. Wait, but if the problem requires that the plane that goes around must return, then the total distance is 2 (around the world and back). But if the plane is going around the world, then it needs to go 1 unit, and then return 1 unit. However, if the problem is that the plane just needs to go around the world (1 unit) and then return (another 1 unit), but the helper planes must return as well. However, the problem says \"get one air plane all the way around the world\", which might mean that the plane just needs to complete the trip, not necessarily return. But the problem says \"all of the air planes must return safely to the airport.\" So the one plane that goes around must return as well. Therefore, the total distance for that plane is 2 units. But each plane can carry 0.5 units. Therefore, the helper planes must transfer fuel to it so that it can have enough fuel for the 2 units.\n\nBut this seems impossible unless there are multiple refueling points. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the plane only needs to go around the world once, and then it doesn't need to return. But the problem says all planes must return. Therefore, the one plane that goes around must return as well. Therefore, the total distance is 2 units. But with the help of other planes.\n\nThis seems very challenging. Let me check the classic problem. In the classic problem, the answer is 3 planes. But I need to verify.\n\nWait, in the classic problem, the plane needs to go around the world, and the other planes can be used to transfer fuel and then return. The key is that the helper planes can meet the main plane at certain points, transfer fuel, and then return. Let me try to outline this.\n\nLet me consider the following approach with 3 planes:\n\n1. All three planes take off together and fly for a distance x. At this point, each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left.\n\n2. Planes B and C transfer fuel to Plane A and then return. To return, they need x fuel each. Therefore, they can transfer (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x fuel each to Plane A.\n\n3. Plane A now has 0.5 - x + 2*(0.5 - 2x) = 1.5 - 5x fuel.\n\n4. Plane A continues flying. The distance remaining to go around the world is 1 - x. But since Plane A needs to return, it needs to go 1 - x to complete the circle and then return x to get back. Wait, no. If Plane A is going around the world, it needs to go 1 unit, then return 1 unit. But if it's already at distance x from the island, then to go around the world, it needs to go 1 - x units, and then return x units. Wait, that's a total of 1 - x + x = 1 unit. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if the plane is at distance x from the island, going around the world would mean going 1 - x units to reach the other side, and then returning would be another 1 - x units? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, the total distance around the world is 1 unit. If the plane is at distance x from the island, then to go around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units to reach the point opposite the island, and then another x units to return. Wait, no. If the plane is flying along a great circle, then the distance from the island to the opposite point is 0.5 units. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me imagine the island is at point 0, and the plane is flying along a circle. The total circumference is 1 unit. The plane can fly 0.5 units on a full tank. So, if the plane is at position x, to go around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units to reach the end, and then return would be another 1 - x units? No, that's not correct. If the plane is at position x, to go all the way around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units to reach the end, and then to return, it would need to fly 1 unit back. Wait, no. If the plane is at position x, going around the world would mean flying 1 - x units to reach the end, and then to return to the island, it would need to fly 1 unit in the opposite direction. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of fuel required.\n\nIf the plane needs to go around the world (distance 1) and return (another distance 1), total 2 units. But each plane can carry 0.5 units. Therefore, the plane needs to have 2 units of fuel, but can only carry 0.5. Therefore, it needs to be refueled multiple times by other planes.\n\nBut the problem is that the other planes must return as well. So, the fuel transferred must be done in such a way that the helper planes can return.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of multiple trips where planes can meet and transfer fuel. Let me try to think of it in segments.\n\nLet me consider that the journey is divided into segments where planes can meet and transfer fuel. For example, if we have three planes, they can fly out, transfer fuel, and return.\n\nLet me try with three planes again, but this time considering that the main plane needs to go around the world and return.\n\nFirst, all three planes take off together. They fly for a distance x. At this point, each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left.\n\nNow, Planes B and C transfer fuel to Plane A and return. As before, they can transfer 0.5 - 2x each. So Plane A now has 1.5 - 5x fuel.\n\nPlane A needs to have enough fuel to go the rest of the way around the world and return. Wait, but if Plane A is at distance x from the island, to go around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units, and then return would be another 1 - x units? No, that's not right. If the plane is at position x, going around the world would mean flying 1 - x units to reach the end, and then to return to the island, it would need to fly 1 unit in the opposite direction. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as a circle.\n\nImagine the island is at point 0. The plane flies clockwise. To go around the world, it needs to reach point 1 (the same as point 0). If it's at position x, then to go around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units. Then, to return to the island, it would need to fly 1 unit in the opposite direction (counterclockwise), but that's not necessary if it's allowed to just complete the trip. Wait, the problem says \"get one air plane all the way around the world\", so maybe it doesn't need to return. But the problem says all planes must return. So the main plane must return as well. Therefore, the total distance for the main plane is 2 units (go around and return). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main plane goes around the world (1 unit) and then returns (another 1 unit), totaling 2 units. But with the help of other planes.\n\nBut this seems impossible with only 3 planes. Let me check the classic problem. In the classic problem, the answer is 3 planes, but I need to verify the steps.\n\nWait, in the classic problem, the plane needs to go around the world with the help of other planes, and the other planes return. The minimum number is 3. Let me try to outline that.\n\nLet me consider that the main plane needs to go around the world, and two helper planes help it by transferring fuel and returning.\n\nFirst, all three planes take off together. They fly for a distance x. At this point, each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left.\n\nNow, the two helper planes transfer fuel to the main plane and return. Each helper plane can transfer (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x fuel to the main plane. So the main plane receives 2*(0.5 - 2x) = 1 - 4x fuel. The main plane now has its original 0.5 - x plus 1 - 4x, totaling 1.5 - 5x fuel.\n\nThe main plane needs to have enough fuel to go the rest of the way around the world. The distance remaining is 1 - x. So the fuel required is 1 - x. Therefore, 1.5 - 5x ≥ 1 - x → 0.5 ≥ 4x → x ≤ 0.125.\n\nSo if x is 0.125, then the main plane has 1.5 - 5*(0.125) = 1.5 - 0.625 = 0.875 fuel. The distance remaining is 1 - 0.125 = 0.875. So the main plane can just make it. But then, after reaching the end, it needs to return. Wait, but the problem says all planes must return. So the main plane needs to return as well. Therefore, after going around the world, it needs to have enough fuel to return. But in this case, the main plane has just enough fuel to go from x=0.125 to the end (distance 0.875), but then it has no fuel left to return. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The previous calculation only allows the main plane to go to the end, but not return. Therefore, we need to have more planes to help it return.\n\nThis suggests that the classic problem might have a different setup. Maybe the main plane doesn't need to return, but the problem here says all planes must return. Therefore, the problem is more complex.\n\nLet me think again. If all planes must return, then the main plane must also return. Therefore, the total fuel required for the main plane is 2 units (go around and return). But each plane can carry 0.5 units. Therefore, the main plane needs to be refueled multiple times by other planes.\n\nLet me consider using more planes. Let's say we have 4 planes. Let me try to outline a possible strategy.\n\nFirst, all four planes take off together. They fly for a distance x. Each has used x fuel, so they have 0.5 - x left.\n\nNow, two planes (Planes 2 and 3) transfer fuel to the main plane (Plane 1) and return. Each can transfer (0.5 - x) - x = 0.5 - 2x fuel. So Plane 1 gets 2*(0.5 - 2x) = 1 - 4x fuel. Plane 1 now has 0.5 - x + 1 - 4x = 1.5 - 5x fuel.\n\nThen, Plane 1 continues flying. Let's say it flies to a point y, where it needs more fuel. But this seems too vague. Alternatively, maybe we need multiple refueling points.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of it as multiple stages. For example, first, some planes help the main plane go halfway, then others help it go the rest.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me look for a systematic way.\n\nIn the classic problem where the plane doesn't need to return, the minimum number is 3. But since in our case the plane must return, it might require more planes. However, I need to check.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the plane only needs to go around the world once, and then it can return using the same fuel. Wait, no, going around the world is 1 unit, and returning is another 1 unit. So total 2 units. But if the plane can be refueled mid-flight, then it can have enough fuel.\n\nLet me think of it as needing to have fuel for 2 units, but with help from other planes.\n\nLet me consider that the main plane needs to have fuel for 2 units. To get that, other planes can transfer fuel to it at different points.\n\nFor example, if two planes help the main plane at two different points.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Let me try to find the answer through research or logical deduction.\n\nIn the classic problem, the answer is 3 planes. However, that problem usually assumes that the plane doesn't need to return, but the helpers do. If the main plane must return, then it might require more planes. However, I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nIf the main plane needs to go around the world (1 unit) and return (another 1 unit), total 2 units. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. So the main plane needs 2 units of fuel. To get this, other planes can transfer fuel to it.\n\nBut each transfer requires that the helper planes return, so they can't just give all their fuel. Let me think of it as needing to have multiple refueling points.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two helper planes. They fly out with the main plane, transfer some fuel, and return. Then, the main plane continues, and another set of planes help it on the return trip.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Let me try with 3 planes again, but this time considering that the main plane needs to return.\n\nFirst, all three planes take off together. They fly for x distance. Each has 0.5 - x fuel.\n\nPlanes 2 and 3 transfer fuel to Plane 1 and return. As before, Plane 1 has 1.5 - 5x fuel.\n\nNow, Plane 1 needs to go the rest of the way around the world (1 - x) and then return (another 1 - x). Wait, no. If it's at distance x from the island, to go around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units, and then to return, it needs to fly 1 unit in the opposite direction. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as a circle.\n\nIf the main plane is at position x, to go around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units to reach the end, and then to return to the island, it needs to fly 1 unit in the opposite direction. But that would be 1 - x + 1 = 2 - x units total. But this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the main plane goes around the world, it's at position 1 (same as 0), and then to return, it needs to fly 1 unit back. But that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the main plane doesn't need to return, but the problem says all planes must return. Therefore, the main plane must return, so it needs to have enough fuel to go around the world and then return. But this seems impossible with the given fuel capacity unless there are multiple refueling points.\n\nLet me try to think of it as needing to have fuel for 2 units, with help from other planes.\n\nLet me consider that the main plane needs to have fuel for 2 units. To get this, other planes can transfer fuel to it at different points.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two helper planes. They fly out with the main plane, transfer some fuel, and return. Then, the main plane continues, and another set of planes help it on the return trip.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to find a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me denote the total fuel required for the main plane to go around the world and return as 2 units. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. The helper planes can transfer fuel to the main plane, but they must return, so they can't give all their fuel.\n\nLet me assume that we have n helper planes. Each helper plane can transfer some fuel to the main plane at certain points, and then return.\n\nBut this is too abstract. Let me look for a known solution.\n\nAfter some research, I recall that the classic problem where a plane needs to go around the world with the help of other planes, and all helpers return, requires 3 planes. However, in that problem, the main plane doesn't need to return. If the main plane must return, it might require more planes. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the main plane needs to go around the world (1 unit) and return (another 1 unit), total 2 units. Each plane can carry 0.5 units. So the main plane needs 2 units of fuel. To get this, other planes can transfer fuel to it.\n\nLet me consider that the main plane is assisted by two other planes. Let's say all three take off together. They fly for x distance. Each has 0.5 - x fuel.\n\nPlanes 2 and 3 transfer fuel to Plane 1 and return. As before, Plane 1 has 1.5 - 5x fuel.\n\nNow, Plane 1 needs to have enough fuel to go the rest of the way around the world (1 - x) and then return (another 1 unit). Wait, no. If it's at distance x from the island, to go around the world, it needs to fly 1 - x units, and then to return, it needs to fly 1 unit in the opposite direction. But that would be 1 - x + 1 = 2 - x units. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if the main plane goes around the world (1 unit) and then returns (another 1 unit), but it can't do that with the fuel it has. So maybe it needs to be refueled at the halfway point.\n\nLet me think of it as needing to have fuel for 1 unit to go around and 1 unit to return, but with help from other planes.\n\nLet me try with 3 planes again, but this time, after the main plane goes around the world, it needs to return. So, let's say the main plane goes around the world with the help of two planes, and then returns with the help of other planes.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. I think I need to refer to the classic solution.\n\nIn the classic problem, the minimum number of planes required to get one plane around the world (without returning) is 3. The steps are:\n\n1. All three planes take off together and fly for 1/8 of the distance. At this point, each has used 1/8 fuel, so they have 3/8 left.\n\n2. Two planes transfer 1/8 fuel each to the third plane, giving it 3/8 + 2*(1/8) = 5/8 fuel. The two planes now have 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel each, which is enough to return to the island.\n\n3. The third plane continues flying, now with 5/8 fuel. It can fly another 5/8 distance, reaching 1/8 + 5/8 = 6/8 = 3/4 of the way around the world.\n\n4. Now, the two planes that returned to the island take off again and meet the third plane at the 3/4 mark. They fly for 1/8 distance to meet it, using 1/8 fuel each, leaving them with 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 fuel each.\n\n5. They transfer 1/8 fuel each to the third plane, giving",
