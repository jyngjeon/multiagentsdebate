    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many people are required in a room for there to be a more than 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday. Hmm, I remember this is called the birthday problem. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the problem is counterintuitive because people often think the number is higher, like 365 or something, but the actual answer is much lower. But I need to recall the exact number and the reasoning behind it.\n\nThe key here is to calculate the probability that all birthdays are unique and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least two people share a birthday. So, if I can find the number of people where this probability exceeds 50%, that's the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering the probability that no two people share a birthday. For the first person, there are 365 possible days. The second person has 364 days to avoid a collision, the third person 363, and so on. So, for n people, the probability that all birthdays are unique is 365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365 * ... * (365 - n + 1)/365.\n\nSo, the formula is P(n) = 365! / [(365 - n)! * 365^n]. Then, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is 1 - P(n). We need to find the smallest n where 1 - P(n) > 0.5, which means P(n) < 0.5.\n\nNow, I need to compute this for different values of n. Let me try with n=23. I think that's the commonly cited number. Let me check.\n\nFor n=23, the probability that all birthdays are unique would be 365/365 * 364/365 * ... * 343/365. That's a product of 23 terms. Calculating this exactly might be tedious, but I remember that the result is approximately 0.4927, which is just under 50%. Therefore, 1 - 0.4927 ≈ 0.5073, which is over 50%. So, with 23 people, the probability exceeds 50%.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Maybe I should do a quick calculation for n=22 and n=23 to see the difference.\n\nFor n=22, the probability would be 365/365 * 364/365 * ... * 344/365. Let me compute that. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the probability of no collisions:\n\nP(n) = product from k=0 to n-1 of (365 - k)/365.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithms or approximations. But maybe I can use the approximation that ln(P(n)) ≈ -n(n-1)/(2*365). Wait, that's an approximation for the probability of no collisions. Let me see.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the exact calculation. Let me try with n=23.\n\nThe exact value for n=23 is known to be approximately 0.4927, so 1 - 0.4927 ≈ 0.5073, which is over 50%. Therefore, 23 people are needed.\n\nBut I should make sure that with 22 people, the probability is less than 50%. Let me check that. For n=22, the probability of all unique birthdays is:\n\nP(22) = 365/365 * 364/365 * ... * 344/365.\n\nCalculating this product step by step would be time-consuming, but I can use the formula or refer to known values. From what I recall, P(22) is approximately 0.5243, which is about 52.43%, so 1 - 0.5243 ≈ 0.4757, which is less than 50%. Therefore, with 22 people, the probability is still under 50%, and with 23, it crosses over.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 23 people. But I need to make sure I'm not confusing the numbers. Let me think again. Another way to approximate is using the formula:\n\nThe probability that all birthdays are unique is approximately e^(-n(n-1)/(2*365)). Setting this equal to 0.5:\n\ne^(-n(n-1)/(2*365)) = 0.5\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n-n(n-1)/(2*365) = ln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nn(n-1)/(2*365) ≈ 0.6931\n\nMultiply both sides by 2*365:\n\nn(n-1) ≈ 0.6931 * 2 * 365 ≈ 0.6931 * 730 ≈ 505.9\n\nSo, n(n-1) ≈ 505.9. Let's solve for n:\n\nn^2 - n - 505.9 ≈ 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nn = [1 + sqrt(1 + 4*505.9)] / 2 ≈ [1 + sqrt(1 + 2023.6)] / 2 ≈ [1 + sqrt(2024.6)] / 2\n\nsqrt(2024.6) is approximately 45 (since 45^2=2025). So, sqrt(2024.6) ≈ 45. So, n ≈ (1 + 45)/2 = 46/2 = 23. So, this approximation gives n≈23, which matches the exact calculation. Therefore, the answer is 23 people.\n\nBut I should also consider that the approximation might be slightly off, but since the exact value for n=23 is known to be just over 50%, this seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that with each additional person, the probability increases, and the number is surprisingly low because the number of possible pairs grows quadratically with n. For 23 people, there are C(23,2) = 253 pairs, and each pair has a 1/365 chance of matching. However, these events are not independent, so the exact calculation is needed, but the approximation gives a sense of why it's around 23.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 23 people.\n</think>\n\nThe number of people required in a room to have a probability exceeding 50% that at least two share the same birthday is **23**. \n\n### Key Reasoning:\n1. **Probability of No Shared Birthdays**:  \n   For $ n $ people, the probability that all birthdays are unique is:  \n   $$\n   P(n) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\dots \\times \\frac{365 - n + 1}{365}\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:  \n   $$\n   P(n) = \\frac{365!}{(365 - n)! \\times 365^n}\n   $$\n\n2. **Probability of At Least One Shared Birthday**:  \n   The probability that **at least two people share a birthday** is:  \n   $$\n   1 - P(n)\n   $$\n   We seek the smallest $ n $ such that $ 1 - P(n) > 0.5 $, i.e., $ P(n) < 0.5 $.\n\n3. **Exact Calculation**:  \n   - For $ n = 22 $, $ P(22) \\approx 0.5243 $ (probability of no shared birthdays is ~52.43%).  \n   - For $ n = 23 $, $ P(23) \\approx 0.4927 $ (probability of no shared birthdays is ~49.27%).  \n   Thus, $ 1 - P(23) \\approx 0.5073 $, which exceeds 50%.\n\n4. **Approximation via Exponential Formula**:  \n   Using the approximation $ P(n) \\approx e^{-n(n-1)/(2 \\times 365)} $, solving $ e^{-n(n-1)/730} = 0.5 $ gives $ n \\approx 23 $, aligning with the exact result.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe counterintuitive result arises because the number of possible pairs grows quadratically with $ n $, increasing the likelihood of a collision. **23 people** are sufficient to make the probability of a shared birthday exceed 50%.",

    "answer": [
        "23"
    ],
    "explanation": "To understand this, you need to consider all possible pairs among people in the room, not just consider each new person entering the room pairing with the people already in the room. Therefore, when there are 23 people in a room, there are 253 possible pairs. The chance of these 23 people having different birthdays is: (364 / 365) ^ 253 = 0.4995. This is why it only takes 23 people to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%.",
    "incorrect answer": [
        "183"
    ],
    "incorrect explanation": "Many people's intuition would tell them that since there are 365 days in a year, it would take close to 365/2, or about 182 or 183 people, to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%.",
    "Whether there is a preference": "Yes",
    "Supported Side": "Affirmative",
    "Reason": "The affirmative side provided a mathematically rigorous explanation using exact probability calculations and approximations, confirming that 23 people are required for the probability of a shared birthday to exceed 50%. The negative side's challenge lacks a specific alternative answer and relies on common misconceptions (e.g., confusing the pigeonhole principle with probability). The exact calculation for 23 people (P(no collision) ≈ 49.27%) and the quadratic growth of pairwise comparisons validate the answer.",
