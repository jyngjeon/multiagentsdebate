    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So there's this classic bridge crossing problem. Four people need to cross a bridge at night, and they have only one torch. The bridge can hold two people at a time, and each person has a different time to cross: 1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes. The goal is to find the shortest total time for all of them to get across.\n\nHmm, I remember that these types of problems usually involve some strategy where the fastest people help shuttle the torch back and forth. But I need to think through the steps carefully.\n\nFirst, let me list the people with their crossing times. Let's call them A (1 min), B (2 min), C (7 min), and D (10 min). The challenge is to get all of them across in the least time possible.\n\nThe key constraints are that only two can cross at a time, and the torch must be carried back and forth. So, every time someone crosses, they need the torch, and someone has to bring it back unless they're on the starting side.\n\nI think the standard approach for these problems is to either have the two fastest people act as the torch carriers or to use a strategy where the slowest people cross together to minimize the time they take. Let me try to outline possible strategies.\n\nOne common method is:\n\n1. The two fastest people cross first. Then one comes back with the torch.\n2. Then the two slowest people cross together. Then the other fast person comes back.\n3. Finally, the two fast people cross again.\n\nLet me try that with the given numbers.\n\nFirst, A (1) and B (2) cross. That takes 2 minutes (since the slower of the two determines the time). Then A comes back with the torch. That's 1 minute. Total so far: 2 + 1 = 3 minutes.\n\nNext, the two slowest, C (7) and D (10), cross together. That takes 10 minutes. Then B (2) comes back with the torch. That's 2 minutes. Total now: 3 + 10 + 2 = 15 minutes.\n\nFinally, A and B cross again. That's 2 minutes. Total time: 15 + 2 = 17 minutes.\n\nWait, but I think there's another strategy where instead of sending the two slowest together, you might have the fastest person go back each time. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternative strategy:\n\n1. A and D cross first. That would take 10 minutes. Then A comes back with the torch (1 min). Total: 11.\n\n2. Then A and C cross. That takes 7 minutes. Then A comes back (1 min). Total: 11 + 7 + 1 = 19.\n\n3. Then A and B cross. 2 minutes. Total: 19 + 2 = 21. That's worse than 17. So that's not better.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe send the fastest with the slowest first?\n\nWait, maybe the first method I thought of is better. Let me check again.\n\nFirst method: A and B cross (2), A returns (1). Then C and D cross (10), B returns (2). Then A and B cross again (2). Total: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17.\n\nIs there a way to get it lower than 17?\n\nAnother strategy I remember is sometimes called the \"two slowest together\" approach, but maybe there's a different way. Let me think.\n\nWhat if we first send the fastest and the second fastest across, then have the fastest come back. Then send the two slowest across, then have the second fastest come back. Then the two fastest cross again. That's the same as the first method, which gives 17.\n\nAlternatively, another method: Let's try sending the fastest with the slowest first, but that might not be efficient. Wait, but maybe there's a different sequence.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Let me try:\n\n1. A and C cross (7 minutes). Then A returns (1). Total: 8.\n\n2. A and D cross (10). Then A returns (1). Total: 8 + 10 + 1 = 19.\n\n3. A and B cross (2). Total: 19 + 2 = 21. That's worse.\n\nNope, that's worse. How about:\n\n1. A and B cross (2). A returns (1). Total: 3.\n\n2. A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Total: 3 + 7 + 1 = 11.\n\n3. A and D cross (10). Total: 11 + 10 = 21. Still worse.\n\nHmm. What if we do:\n\n1. A and D cross (10). A returns (1). Total: 11.\n\n2. A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Total: 11 + 7 + 1 = 19.\n\n3. A and B cross (2). Total: 19 + 2 = 21. Same as before.\n\nNot better. So maybe the first method is better.\n\nWait, but I think there's another approach where instead of sending the two slowest together, you send one slow and one fast, but that might not help. Let me think.\n\nWait, here's another strategy. Let me check the standard solution for this problem. I think the standard answer is 17 minutes, but I want to make sure.\n\nWait, another way: Let's try sending the two fastest first, then one back, then the two slowest, then the other fast back, then the two fast again. That's the same as the first method.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to have the second fastest person do some of the returning?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose:\n\n1. A and B cross (2). Then B returns (2). Total: 4.\n\n2. Then C and D cross (10). Then A returns (1). Total: 4 + 10 + 1 = 15.\n\n3. Then A and B cross again (2). Total: 15 + 2 = 17. Same as before.\n\nSo that's the same total time. So whether B or A returns in the first step, the total is same? Wait, in the first method, A returns first, then B returns. In this case, B returns first, then A returns. But the total time is same.\n\nSo that's 17 minutes. Is there a way to get lower?\n\nWait, what if we do:\n\n1. A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Total: 8.\n\n2. A and D cross (10). A returns (1). Total: 8 + 10 + 1 = 19.\n\n3. A and B cross (2). Total: 19 + 2 = 21. No, worse.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe send B and C first? Let's see.\n\n1. B (2) and C (7) cross. That takes 7 minutes. Then B returns (2). Total: 7 + 2 = 9.\n\n2. Then B and D cross (10). Then B returns (2). Total: 9 + 10 + 2 = 21.\n\n3. Then A and B cross (2). Total: 21 + 2 = 23. Worse.\n\nNope. How about:\n\n1. A and D cross (10). A returns (1). Total: 11.\n\n2. A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Total: 11 + 7 + 1 = 19.\n\n3. A and B cross (2). Total: 19 + 2 = 21. Still worse.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe send A and B first, then A back, then A and C, then A back, then A and D. That would be:\n\n1. A and B cross (2). A returns (1). Total: 3.\n\n2. A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Total: 3 + 7 + 1 = 11.\n\n3. A and D cross (10). Total: 11 + 10 = 21. Same as before.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nWait, so the first method gives 17 minutes. Is that the minimum?\n\nI think that's the standard answer. Let me check if there's a different combination.\n\nWait, here's another idea. What if we first send A and C across, then have A come back. Then send A and D across, then A comes back. Then A and B cross. But that's the same as before, which totals 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. No.\n\nAlternatively, what if we send A and B first, then B comes back. Then send C and D, then A comes back. Then A and B cross again. That's:\n\n1. A and B cross (2). B returns (2). Total: 4.\n\n2. C and D cross (10). A returns (1). Total: 4 + 10 + 1 = 15.\n\n3. A and B cross (2). Total: 15 + 2 = 17. Same as before.\n\nSo regardless of whether A or B returns in the first step, the total is same. So 17 minutes.\n\nIs there a way to get it lower? Let me think of another approach.\n\nWhat if we first send A and C across (7), then A returns (1). Then send A and D across (10), then A returns (1). Then send A and B across (2). Total: 7 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 21. No.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe send A and B first, then A returns. Then send A and D, then A returns. Then send A and C. But that would be:\n\n1. A and B cross (2). A returns (1). Total: 3.\n\n2. A and D cross (10). A returns (1). Total: 3 + 10 + 1 = 14.\n\n3. A and C cross (7). Total: 14 + 7 = 21. Still worse.\n\nHmm. So seems like 17 is the minimum. Let me check if there's a different sequence where the two slowest cross together but with different steps.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's say A and D cross first (10), then A returns (1). Then A and C cross (7), then A returns (1). Then A and B cross (2). Total: 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21. No.\n\nAlternatively, what if we first send B and D across? That would take 10 minutes. Then B returns (2). Then B and C cross (7). Then B returns (2). Then A and B cross (2). Total: 10 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 23. Worse.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe send A and C first (7), then B and D cross (10). But how? Wait, they need the torch. So if A and C cross, then someone has to bring the torch back. Let's try:\n\n1. A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Total: 8.\n\n2. Then B and D cross (10). B returns (2). Total: 8 + 10 + 2 = 20.\n\n3. Then A and B cross (2). Total: 20 + 2 = 22. Still worse than 17.\n\nNope. So seems like 17 is the best so far.\n\nWait, but I remember that in some variations, the optimal time is 17, but maybe there's a different way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let me check the standard solution for this problem. The classic problem with 1, 2, 5, 10 minutes is solved in 17 minutes. Wait, but in this case, the times are 1, 2, 7, 10. So similar logic applies.\n\nThe standard solution is:\n\n1. The two fastest cross first (1 and 2). Time: 2.\n\n2. The fastest returns (1). Time: 1. Total: 3.\n\n3. The two slowest cross (7 and 10). Time: 10. Total: 13.\n\n4. The second fastest returns (2). Time: 2. Total: 15.\n\n5. The two fastest cross again (1 and 2). Time: 2. Total: 17.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So that's 17 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, another method sometimes used is:\n\n1. The fastest and the slowest cross first. Then the fastest returns. Then the fastest and the next slowest cross. Then the fastest returns. Then the two fastest cross. But that would be:\n\n1. A and D cross (10). A returns (1). Total: 11.\n\n2. A and C cross (7). A returns (1). Total: 11 + 7 + 1 = 19.\n\n3. A and B cross (2). Total: 19 + 2 = 21. Which is worse.\n\nSo the first method is better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time is 17 minutes.\n</think>\n\nThe shortest time needed for all four people to cross the bridge is **17 minutes**. Here's the optimal strategy:\n\n1. **A (1 min) and B (2 min) cross together** â†’ Time taken: **2 minutes**.  \n   (Total: 2)  \n2. **A (1 min) returns with the torch** â†’ Time taken: **1 minute**.  \n   (Total: 3)  \n3. **C (7 min) and D (10 min) cross together** â†’ Time taken: **10 minutes**.  \n   (Total: 13)  \n4. **B (2 min) returns with the torch** â†’ Time taken: **2 minutes**.  \n   (Total: 15)  \n5. **A (1 min) and B (2 min) cross together again** â†’ Time taken: **2 minutes**.  \n   (Total: **17 minutes**).  \n\nThis approach minimizes the time by leveraging the fastest individuals (A and B) to shuttle the torch efficiently, ensuring the two slowest individuals (C and D) cross together to avoid wasting time on separate crossings. \n\n**Answer:** 17 minutes.",
