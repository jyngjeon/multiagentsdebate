    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says a man is given a task, and he doubles the amount of work he does every day. He finishes the entire task in 20 days. The question is, how many days did it take him to complete 25% of the task?\n\nHmm, so first, I need to understand how the doubling works. If he doubles the task done each day, does that mean that each day he does twice as much as the previous day? So like, on day 1, he does x amount, day 2 he does 2x, day 3 he does 4x, and so on? That seems like exponential growth. So the total work done after n days would be the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but the problem says he completes the task in 20 days. So the total work is the sum of all the work he does each day up to day 20. Let me think. If each day he doubles the previous day's work, then the work done on day k is 2^{k-1} times the work done on day 1. So the total work after 20 days would be the sum from k=0 to 19 of 2^k times the work on day 1. Wait, but that sum is 2^{20} - 1 times the work on day 1. Because the sum of a geometric series with ratio 2 is 2^n - 1.\n\nBut the total task is equal to that sum. So if the total task is T, then T = (2^{20} - 1) * x, where x is the work done on day 1. But the problem says he completes the task in 20 days. So the total work is T = sum_{k=1}^{20} work on day k. Which is x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^{19}x. Which is x*(2^{20} - 1). So T = x*(2^{20} - 1).\n\nNow, the question is, when did he complete 25% of the task? So 25% of T is 0.25*T. We need to find the day when the cumulative work reaches 0.25*T.\n\nBut wait, the cumulative work on day n is sum_{k=1}^n 2^{k-1}x = x*(2^n - 1). So we set that equal to 0.25*T. Since T = x*(2^{20} - 1), substituting:\n\nx*(2^n - 1) = 0.25 * x*(2^{20} - 1)\n\nWe can cancel x from both sides:\n\n2^n - 1 = 0.25*(2^{20} - 1)\n\nThen, solving for n:\n\n2^n = 0.25*(2^{20} - 1) + 1\n\nBut 0.25*(2^{20} - 1) is (2^{20} - 1)/4. So:\n\n2^n = (2^{20} - 1)/4 + 1 = (2^{20} - 1 + 4)/4 = (2^{20} + 3)/4\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me check if my initial assumption is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the man doubles the task done each day, meaning that each day he does twice as much as the previous day. So the total work is the sum of a geometric series. But if he finishes the task on day 20, that means that on day 20, the cumulative work equals the total task. So the total task is the sum from day 1 to day 20 of 2^{k-1}x, which is x*(2^{20} - 1). Therefore, 25% of the task is 0.25*x*(2^{20} - 1). We need to find the smallest n such that the sum from day 1 to day n of 2^{k-1}x is at least 0.25*T.\n\nBut since the total T is x*(2^{20} - 1), then 0.25*T is x*(2^{20} - 1)/4. So we need to find n where x*(2^n - 1) >= x*(2^{20} - 1)/4. Again, cancelling x:\n\n2^n - 1 >= (2^{20} - 1)/4\n\nSo 2^n >= (2^{20} - 1)/4 + 1 = (2^{20} - 1 + 4)/4 = (2^{20} + 3)/4\n\nBut 2^{20} is a huge number, so 2^{20} + 3 is approximately 2^{20}, so (2^{20} + 3)/4 ≈ 2^{18} + 3/4. Therefore, 2^n ≈ 2^{18} + 0.75. So n is approximately 18. But since 2^18 is 262144, and 2^18 + 0.75 is just a tiny bit more than 2^18, so n would be 18. But wait, let's check:\n\nIf n=18, then 2^18 -1 = 262144 -1 = 262143. The total T is 2^20 -1 = 1048575. So 25% of T is 1048575 /4 = 262143.75. So the cumulative work on day 18 is 2^18 -1 = 262143, which is just 0.75 less than 262143.75. Therefore, on day 18, he hasn't completed 25% yet. Then on day 19, the cumulative work is 2^19 -1 = 524287. Which is way more than 262143.75. Therefore, the 25% is completed on day 19. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Because if the total is 1048575, then 25% is 262143.75. The cumulative work on day 18 is 262143, which is just 0.75 less. So he would reach 25% on day 19, because on day 19, he does 2^18 work, which is 262144. So adding that to the previous 262143 gives 524287, which is way over. But the question is, when did he complete 25% of the task. So the exact point when the cumulative work reaches 25% would be during day 19, but since the problem is about days, maybe it's considered that on day 19, he completes the 25%? But the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says \"he doubles the task done everyday.\" Maybe that means that each day, he does double the amount of the task compared to the previous day. So on day 1, he does x, day 2 he does 2x, day 3 he does 4x, etc. So the total work after n days is x*(2^n -1). But the total task is completed on day 20, so x*(2^20 -1) = total task. Therefore, 25% of the task is 0.25*x*(2^20 -1). We need to find n such that x*(2^n -1) = 0.25*x*(2^20 -1). So 2^n -1 = 0.25*(2^20 -1). Then 2^n = 0.25*(2^20 -1) +1. Let's compute that:\n\n0.25*(2^20 -1) = (2^20 -1)/4 = 2^18 - 1/4. Then adding 1 gives 2^18 - 1/4 +1 = 2^18 + 3/4. So 2^n = 2^18 + 3/4. Since 2^18 is 262144, adding 3/4 gives 262144.75. So 2^n is approximately 262144.75. But 2^18 is 262144, and 2^19 is 524288. So 2^n is between 2^18 and 2^19. Therefore, n is between 18 and 19. But since n has to be an integer, the cumulative work reaches 25% on day 19. Because on day 18, the cumulative work is 2^18 -1 = 262143, which is less than 262143.75. On day 19, the cumulative work is 2^19 -1 = 524287, which is more than 262143.75. Therefore, the answer would be day 19. But that seems like a lot of days to get to 25% when the total is done in 20 days. Wait, but with exponential growth, the majority of the work is done in the last few days. So maybe that's correct. For example, on day 19, he does 2^18 work, which is half of the total work (since total is 2^20 -1 ≈ 2^20). So 2^18 is 1/4 of 2^20, so that's 25% of the total. Wait, but the total is 2^20 -1, which is very close to 2^20. So 2^18 is 1/4 of 2^20, so 25% of the total. Therefore, the work done on day 19 is 2^18, which is 25% of the total. But the cumulative work up to day 19 is 2^19 -1, which is 524287, which is more than 25% of the total. Wait, but the total is 1048575. 25% of that is 262143.75. So the cumulative work on day 18 is 262143, which is just 0.75 less than 25%. Then on day 19, he does 262144 work, which would take the cumulative to 262143 + 262144 = 524287, which is more than 25%. Therefore, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But the question is asking how many days did it take to complete 25% of the task. If we consider that the task is completed on day 20, then the 25% is completed on day 19. But maybe the problem is expecting a different approach where the task is completed on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he does the remaining work. Wait, but the problem says he doubles the task done every day. So maybe the way to think about it is that on day 20, he does the last part of the task, which is the remaining amount. But if the total is T, then on day 20, he does T - (sum of previous days). But if the sum of previous days is S, then on day 20, he does 2*S. Because he doubles the previous day's work. Wait, that might be a different interpretation.\n\nLet me try that approach. Suppose that each day, he does double the amount of work he did the previous day. So on day 1, he does x. On day 2, he does 2x. On day 3, 4x. So on day n, he does 2^{n-1}x. The total work done after n days is x*(2^n -1). If he completes the task on day 20, then x*(2^20 -1) = T. Therefore, T = x*(2^20 -1). Now, 25% of T is 0.25*T = 0.25*x*(2^20 -1). We need to find the day n where the cumulative work is at least 0.25*T. As before, that would be when x*(2^n -1) >= 0.25*x*(2^20 -1). So 2^n -1 >= 0.25*(2^20 -1). As before, solving for n gives n ≈ 18. But since on day 18, the cumulative is 2^18 -1 = 262143, which is just slightly less than 0.25*T (which is 262143.75). Therefore, on day 19, he does 2^18 x, which is 262144x, adding to the previous 262143x gives 524287x, which is more than 0.25*T. Therefore, the answer is day 19. But that seems counterintuitive because 25% is a quarter of the total, but with exponential growth, the majority of the work is done in the last few days. So maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to think that since on day 20 he finishes the task, then on day 19 he had done half the task, and on day 18, a quarter. But that would be if the work was doubling each day, so the last day's work is the total. Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nIf the man doubles the task done every day, and finishes on day 20, then on day 20, he did the last part of the task. If the total task is T, then on day 20, he did T - (sum of previous days). But if he doubles the previous day's work, then the work on day 20 is 2*(work on day 19). Let me denote the work on day n as W_n. Then W_n = 2*W_{n-1}. The total work T = sum_{n=1}^{20} W_n. But since W_n = 2^{n-1} * W_1, then T = W_1*(2^{20} -1). Now, if we think about the work done on day 20, which is W_20 = 2^{19} * W_1. The total T = W_1*(2^{20} -1) ≈ W_1*2^{20} (since 2^{20} is much larger than 1). Therefore, W_20 ≈ T/2. So on day 20, he did approximately half the task. Then on day 19, he did W_19 = 2^{18} * W_1 ≈ T/4. Therefore, the work done on day 19 is approximately 25% of the total. But the cumulative work up to day 19 is sum_{n=1}^{19} W_n = W_1*(2^{19} -1) ≈ W_1*2^{19} = T/2. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no. If T = W_1*(2^{20} -1), then sum_{n=1}^{19} W_n = W_1*(2^{19} -1). Therefore, the cumulative work up to day 19 is (2^{19} -1)/ (2^{20} -1) * T. Let's compute that ratio:\n\n(2^{19} -1)/(2^{20} -1) = (2^{19} -1)/(2*(2^{19}) -1) ≈ (2^{19})/(2*2^{19}) ) = 1/2. So approximately 50% of the total task. Therefore, the cumulative work up to day 19 is about 50% of the total. Then on day 20, he does the remaining 50%. But that contradicts the previous calculation where the cumulative work on day 18 was 25% of the total. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's confusion here between the work done on a particular day versus the cumulative work. If the total task is T, and the cumulative work up to day n is S_n = W_1*(2^n -1). Then S_20 = T = W_1*(2^{20} -1). Therefore, S_19 = W_1*(2^{19} -1) = T*(2^{19} -1)/(2^{20} -1) ≈ T*(2^{19}/2^{20}) = T/2. So approximately 50% of the task is done by day 19. Then on day 20, he does W_20 = 2^{19} * W_1, which is equal to T*(2^{19}/(2^{20} -1)) ≈ T/2. So the work done on day 20 is approximately half the total, which makes sense because the cumulative up to day 19 is about half, and day 20 adds the other half. Therefore, if the question is asking when he completed 25% of the task, that would be before day 19. Let's compute S_n = 0.25*T. So:\n\nW_1*(2^n -1) = 0.25*T = 0.25*W_1*(2^{20} -1)\n\nCancel W_1:\n\n2^n -1 = 0.25*(2^{20} -1)\n\nSo 2^n = 0.25*(2^{20} -1) +1 = (2^{20} -1)/4 +1 = (2^{20} -1 +4)/4 = (2^{20} +3)/4\n\nNow, 2^{20} is 1048576, so 2^{20} +3 = 1048579. Divided by 4 is 262144.75. So 2^n = 262144.75. Since 2^18 = 262144, and 2^18.000... something is 262144.75. Therefore, n is approximately 18.000... So since n must be an integer, the cumulative work reaches 25% on day 18. But wait, earlier calculation said that S_18 = 2^18 -1 = 262143, which is 0.25*T - 0.75. So it's just slightly less than 25%. Therefore, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But the problem is asking for the number of days it took to complete 25% of the task. If we consider that the task is completed on day 20, then the 25% is completed on day 19. But according to the exact calculation, the cumulative work on day 18 is 262143, which is 0.25*T - 0.75. So it's just a tiny bit less than 25%. Therefore, the 25% is completed on day 19. But this seems to contradict the earlier approximation where S_19 is about 50% of T. Wait, but that approximation was based on T ≈ 2^{20} * W_1, but actually T = 2^{20} * W_1 - W_1. So the exact value of S_19 is (2^{19} -1)/ (2^{20} -1) * T. Let's compute that exactly:\n\n(2^{19} -1)/(2^{20} -1) = (2^{19} -1)/(2*(2^{19}) -1) = Let's compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2^{19} -1 = 524288 -1 = 524287\n\nDenominator: 2*2^{19} -1 = 2^{20} -1 = 1048576 -1 = 1048575\n\nSo the ratio is 524287 / 1048575 ≈ 0.5, which is 50%. Therefore, S_19 is 50% of T. Therefore, the 25% must be achieved on day 18. But according to the exact calculation, S_18 = 2^18 -1 = 262143, and T = 1048575. So 262143 / 1048575 ≈ 0.25, which is exactly 25% minus a tiny bit. Wait, 262143 * 4 = 1,048,572, which is 3 less than T (1,048,575). Therefore, 262143 is 1,048,572 / 4 = 262,143, which is 0.25*T - 0.75. Therefore, the exact 25% is achieved when the cumulative work is 262,143.75. Since on day 18, the cumulative is 262,143, which is just 0.75 less. Therefore, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But since the problem asks for the number of days, it's possible that the answer is day 19. However, in some interpretations, if the work is done in discrete steps, then the 25% is completed on day 19. But if we consider that the work is continuous, then it would be partway through day 19. But the problem doesn't specify continuous work, so it's likely that the answer is day 19. However, this seems counterintuitive because if the total is done in 20 days, and the work doubles each day, then the last day's work is the majority. But according to the math, the 25% is achieved on day 19. Wait, but if the total is T, and on day 19, the cumulative is 50% of T, then 25% would be halfway through day 19. But since the problem is about days, not fractions of days, the answer would be day 19. But I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Suppose that the man completes the task on day 20, meaning that on day 20, he did the last part of the task. If the task is completed on day 20, then the amount of work done on day 20 is equal to the remaining work. Since he doubles the work each day, the work on day 20 is twice the work on day 19. Let me denote the work on day 1 as x. Then work on day 2 is 2x, day 3 is 4x, ..., day 20 is 2^{19}x. The total work T is the sum from day 1 to day 20: x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^{19}x = x*(2^{20} -1). Now, the work done on day 20 is 2^{19}x. The remaining work before day 20 is T - (sum from day 1 to day 19) = x*(2^{20} -1) - x*(2^{19} -1) = x*(2^{20} -1 -2^{19} +1) = x*(2^{20} -2^{19}) = x*2^{19}(2 -1) = x*2^{19}. Which is equal to the work done on day 20. So that checks out. Now, the total work is T = x*(2^{20} -1). 25% of T is 0.25*T = 0.25*x*(2^{20} -1). We need to find the day n where the cumulative work is at least 0.25*T. As before, the cumulative work on day n is x*(2^n -1). Setting this equal to 0.25*T:\n\nx*(2^n -1) = 0.25*x*(2^{20} -1)\n\nCancel x:\n\n2^n -1 = 0.25*(2^{20} -1)\n\nSo 2^n = 0.25*(2^{20} -1) +1 = (2^{20} -1)/4 +1 = (2^{20} -1 +4)/4 = (2^{20} +3)/4\n\nAs before, this is approximately 2^{18} + 3/4. So n is approximately 18.000... So since n must be an integer, the cumulative work reaches 25% on day 19. Therefore, the answer is 19 days. But this seems to contradict the earlier thought that the cumulative work on day 19 is 50% of T. Wait, no. Wait, the cumulative work on day 19 is x*(2^{19} -1). Let's compute that as a fraction of T:\n\n(2^{19} -1)/(2^{20} -1) = (2^{19} -1)/(2*2^{19} -1) ≈ 2^{19}/(2*2^{19}) = 1/2. So approximately 50%. Therefore, the cumulative work on day 19 is about 50% of T. Therefore, the 25% must be achieved on day 18. But according to the exact calculation, the cumulative work on day 18 is x*(2^{18} -1) = 262143x, and T = 1048575x. So 262143x / 1048575x = 262143/1048575 ≈ 0.25, which is exactly 25% minus a tiny bit. Therefore, the 25% is achieved during day 19. But since the problem asks for the number of days, it's possible that the answer is day 19. However, this seems to be a very close call. If the question is from a math competition or something, they might expect the answer to be day 18, considering that the cumulative work on day 18 is very close to 25%. But mathematically, it's just slightly less, so the 25% is completed on day 19. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the work is done in such a way that on day n, the work done that day is 25% of the total. But that would be different. If the question is asking when the man completed 25% of the task, meaning that the total work done up to that day is 25%, then it's day 19. But if it's asking when the work done on a particular day is 25% of the total, then that would be day 19, since the work on day 19 is 2^{18}x, and T is 2^{20}x -x. So 2^{18}x / (2^{20}x -x) = 2^{18}/(2^{20} -1) ≈ 1/4. So approximately 25%. Therefore, the work done on day 19 is approximately 25% of the total. But the cumulative work up to day 19 is about 50%. So depending on interpretation, the answer could be day 18 or day 19. But the problem says \"complete 25% of the task\", which usually refers to the cumulative work, not the work done on a single day. Therefore, the answer should be day 19. However, given that the cumulative work on day 18 is 262143, which is 0.25*T - 0.75, and on day 19 it's 524287, which is 0.5*T + something, the 25% is achieved during day 19. Therefore, the answer is 19 days.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a man completing a task by doubling his daily work each day, finishing the entire task on day 20.
