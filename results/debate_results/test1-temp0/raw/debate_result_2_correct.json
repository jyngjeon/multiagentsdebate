    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is about Alice going out for drinks 9 days out of 10, and she goes to three bars with equal frequency. Bob is trying to find her today but failed after checking two bars. We need to find the probability that Alice is at the third bar.\n\nFirst, let me parse the information. Alice goes out 90% of the time. When she does go out, she picks one of the three bars with equal probability, so each bar has a 1/3 chance. Bob checks two bars and doesn't find her. Now, we need to find the probability that she's at the third bar given that she wasn't at the first two.\n\nWait, but there's also the aspect of whether Alice is even out today. The problem says \"Bob is trying to find Alice today.\" So, does that mean that today is a day when Alice is out? Or is there a chance she's not out at all?\n\nThe original statement says \"9 days among 10 days, Alice goes out for drink.\" So, the probability that Alice is out on any given day is 9/10. But Bob is trying to find her today. However, he failed after going to two bars. So, does that mean that Alice is definitely out today? Because if she wasn't out, then Bob wouldn't find her regardless of the bars he checks. But the problem says he failed after going to two bars. So, maybe we need to consider both possibilities: that Alice is out and not at the first two bars, or that she's not out at all.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability that Alice shows up in the third bar. If she's not out at all, then she's not at any bar. So, maybe the problem is assuming that Alice is out today? Or do we have to account for the possibility that she's not out?\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The problem says \"Bob is trying to find Alice today. However, he fails after going to two bars.\" So, Bob went to two bars and didn't find her. But if Alice wasn't out at all, then Bob would have failed regardless. However, the question is about the probability that Alice is at the third bar. So, maybe we need to compute the conditional probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed to find her in the first two bars.\n\nBut to compute that, we need to know whether Alice is out today or not. Let me try to model this.\n\nFirst, define the events:\n\nLet A be the event that Alice is out today.\n\nLet B be the event that Alice is at bar 1.\n\nLet C be the event that Alice is at bar 2.\n\nLet D be the event that Alice is at bar 3.\n\nLet F be the event that Bob failed to find Alice after checking two bars.\n\nWe need to find P(D | F).\n\nBut to compute this, we need to consider whether Alice is out or not. Because if she's not out, then she's not at any bar, so Bob would have failed. If she is out, then she's at one of the three bars with equal probability.\n\nSo, the probability that Alice is out is 9/10, and not out is 1/10.\n\nSo, the total probability of Bob failing is P(F) = P(F | A) * P(A) + P(F | not A) * P(not A).\n\nIf Alice is not out, then Bob will definitely fail, so P(F | not A) = 1.\n\nIf Alice is out, then the probability that Bob fails after checking two bars depends on where she is. If she is at bar 1 or 2, then Bob would have found her if he checked those bars. If she is at bar 3, then Bob would have failed.\n\nBut wait, Bob checked two bars. Let's assume that Bob checks two different bars. The problem doesn't specify the order, but maybe we can assume that he checks two specific bars, say bar 1 and bar 2, and failed to find her there. Then, the probability that she is at bar 3 given that she is out and not at bar 1 or 2 is 1/3 divided by (probability she is at bar 3 or not out? Wait, no.\n\nWait, if Alice is out, then she is at one of the three bars with equal probability. So, the probability that she is at bar 1 is 1/3, bar 2 is 1/3, bar 3 is 1/3. If Bob checks bar 1 and bar 2 and doesn't find her, then that means she is not at bar 1 or bar 2. Therefore, given that she is out, the probability that she is at bar 3 is 1, because she has to be at one of the three bars. Wait, but that seems like if she is out, and Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, then she must be at the third bar. But that can't be right because if she is out, she is at one of the three bars. If Bob checked two and didn't find her, then she must be at the third. So, in that case, the probability would be 1. But that seems too straightforward. However, this is only if we know that Alice is out. But the problem is that Bob might have failed because Alice wasn't out at all.\n\nSo, the problem is that we need to compute the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed to find her in the first two bars. So, this is a conditional probability where we have to consider both possibilities: Alice is out and at bar 3, or Alice is not out at all.\n\nWait, but if Alice is not out, then she's not at any bar, so she's not at the third bar either. Therefore, the event that Alice is at the third bar is only possible if she is out. Therefore, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed is equal to the probability that she is out and at the third bar, divided by the probability that Bob failed.\n\nSo, mathematically:\n\nP(Alice at bar 3 | Bob failed) = P(Alice is out and at bar 3) / P(Bob failed)\n\nBut P(Alice is out and at bar 3) = P(Alice is out) * P(Alice at bar 3 | Alice is out) = (9/10) * (1/3) = 3/10.\n\nP(Bob failed) = P(Bob failed | Alice is out) * P(Alice is out) + P(Bob failed | Alice is not out) * P(Alice is not out)\n\nIf Alice is out, then Bob failed only if she is at bar 3. Because if she is at bar 1 or 2, Bob would have found her. So, P(Bob failed | Alice is out) = P(Alice is at bar 3) = 1/3.\n\nIf Alice is not out, then Bob failed for sure, so P(Bob failed | Alice is not out) = 1.\n\nTherefore, P(Bob failed) = (1/3)*(9/10) + 1*(1/10) = 3/10 + 1/10 = 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Alice is at bar 3 given that Bob failed is (3/10) / (4/10) = 3/4.\n\nWait, so the answer is 3/4? That seems high, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that if Alice is out, then Bob's failure is only when she is at bar 3. But if Bob checked two bars, say bar 1 and bar 2, then if Alice is out and at bar 3, Bob fails. If she is out and at bar 1 or 2, Bob would have found her. Therefore, yes, P(Bob failed | Alice is out) is 1/3.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the probability is 3/4.\n\nBut let me think again. Another way to approach this is using Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet me define:\n\nEvent H: Alice is out today.\n\nEvent E: Bob failed to find Alice after checking two bars.\n\nWe need to find P(Alice is at bar 3 | E).\n\nBut since if Alice is not out, she can't be at any bar, so the event that she is at bar 3 is only possible if H is true. Therefore, P(Alice at bar 3 | E) = P(H and Alice at bar 3 | E) = P(H and Alice at bar 3)/P(E).\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(Alice at bar 3 | E) = P(E | Alice at bar 3) * P(Alice at bar 3) / P(E)\n\nBut P(E | Alice at bar 3) is the probability that Bob failed given that Alice is at bar 3. Since if Alice is at bar 3, and Bob checked two other bars, then he would have failed. So, P(E | Alice at bar 3) = 1.\n\nP(Alice at bar 3) is the prior probability that Alice is at bar 3, which is P(Alice is out) * P(Alice at bar 3 | Alice is out) = 9/10 * 1/3 = 3/10.\n\nP(E) is 4/10 as before.\n\nTherefore, P(Alice at bar 3 | E) = 1 * 3/10 / (4/10) = 3/4. Same result.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nBut another way to think about it: if we know that Bob failed, then there are two possibilities: either Alice is not out, or she is out and at bar 3. The probability that she is not out is 1/10, and the probability that she is out and at bar 3 is 9/10 * 1/3 = 3/10. So, the total probability of Bob failing is 1/10 + 3/10 = 4/10. Therefore, the probability that she is at bar 3 given that Bob failed is (3/10) / (4/10) = 3/4.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is 3/4.\n\nBut wait, another angle: suppose that Bob checks two bars, and if Alice is out, the chance she is in one of those two bars is 2/3, so the chance she's not in those two is 1/3. Therefore, given that Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, the probability she is out and at the third bar is (9/10)*(1/3) divided by the total probability of Bob failing, which is (9/10)*(1/3) + (1/10)*1 = 3/10 + 1/10 = 4/10. So, 3/10 divided by 4/10 is 3/4. Yep.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3/4, which is 75%.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe the problem assumes that Alice is definitely out today, because Bob is trying to find her. But the problem says \"Bob is trying to find Alice today. However, he fails after going to two bars.\" It doesn't say that Alice is out, just that Bob failed. So, the possibility that she's not out is still there. Therefore, the answer is 3/4.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that Alice is definitely out today, then the probability would be 1, because if she's out, and Bob checked two bars and didn't find her, she must be at the third. But the problem doesn't state that Alice is out, so we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct answer is 3/4.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the probability is 3/4.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob failed to find her in the first two bars is **3/4** (or 75%). Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Key Assumptions**:\n   - Alice goes out 90% of the time (probability $ P(A) = \\frac{9}{10} $) and chooses one of three bars uniformly at random (each bar has $ \\frac{1}{3} $ chance).\n   - Bob checks two specific bars (e.g., Bar 1 and Bar 2) and fails to find Alice.\n   - The failure could occur either because Alice is **not out** (probability $ \\frac{1}{10} $) or because she is **out but at the third bar** (Bar 3).\n\n2. **Conditional Probability**:\n   - **Numerator**: Probability Alice is out and at Bar 3:  \n     $$\n     P(\\text{Out and Bar 3}) = P(\\text{Out}) \\cdot P(\\text{Bar 3} \\mid \\text{Out}) = \\frac{9}{10} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{10}.\n     $$\n   - **Denominator**: Total probability Bob fails:  \n     $$\n     P(\\text{Fail}) = P(\\text{Fail} \\mid \\text{Out}) \\cdot P(\\text{Out}) + P(\\text{Fail} \\mid \\text{Not Out}) \\cdot P(\\text{Not Out}).\n     $$\n     - If Alice is out, Bob fails only if she is at Bar 3: $ P(\\text{Fail} \\mid \\text{Out}) = \\frac{1}{3} $.\n     - If Alice is not out, Bob always fails: $ P(\\text{Fail} \\mid \\text{Not Out}) = 1 $.\n     $$\n     P(\\text{Fail}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{9}{10} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{4}{10}.\n     $$\n\n3. **Final Calculation**:\n   $$\n   P(\\text{Bar 3} \\mid \\text{Fail}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Out and Bar 3})}{P(\\text{Fail})} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{10}}{\\frac{4}{10}} = \\frac{3}{4}.\n   $$\n\n**Answer**: $ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{4}} $",
