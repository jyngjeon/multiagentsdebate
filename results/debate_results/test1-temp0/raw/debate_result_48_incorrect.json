    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the probability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes, given that there's a 95% chance of seeing one in thirty minutes. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, the question is about probability over different time intervals. The key here is probably assuming that the events (seeing a vehicle) are independent over time. But wait, how exactly does the probability work when the time period changes? \n\nI remember that for events that happen at a constant rate, like Poisson processes, the probability of an event occurring in a certain time can be modeled using the exponential distribution. But maybe I should start with a simpler approach. \n\nIf the probability of seeing at least one vehicle in thirty minutes is 95%, then the probability of not seeing any vehicle in thirty minutes is 5%, right? So, P(no vehicle in 30 min) = 0.05. \n\nNow, if I assume that the events are independent in each time interval, then maybe I can model the probability of not seeing a vehicle in ten minutes as some value, say p. Then, over three ten-minute intervals (which make up thirty minutes), the probability of not seeing any vehicle would be p^3. \n\nSo, according to that, p^3 = 0.05. Therefore, p = 0.05^(1/3). Let me calculate that. The cube root of 0.05. Let me see, 0.05 is 5/100, so cube root of 5/100. Let me approximate that. \n\nCube root of 0.05. Let me think. 0.05 is 5*10^-2. The cube root of 5 is about 1.71, and the cube root of 10^-2 is 10^(-2/3) which is approximately 0.215. So multiplying those together: 1.71 * 0.215 ≈ 0.368. So p ≈ 0.368. Therefore, the probability of not seeing a vehicle in ten minutes is approximately 36.8%, so the probability of seeing at least one vehicle in ten minutes would be 1 - 0.368 = 0.632, or 63.2%. \n\nWait, but is this the correct approach? Assuming that the probability of not seeing a vehicle in each ten-minute interval is independent? That seems like a Poisson process assumption, where the events are independent and the rate is constant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. For example, if the probability of seeing a vehicle in thirty minutes is 95%, maybe we can model it as a binomial distribution? But that might not be straightforward. \n\nWait, in a Poisson process, the number of events in a given time interval follows a Poisson distribution. The probability of at least one event in time t is 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the rate parameter. \n\nSo if we have P(at least one event in 30 min) = 1 - e^(-λ*30) = 0.95. Then, solving for λ: e^(-λ*30) = 0.05. Taking natural logs: -λ*30 = ln(0.05). Therefore, λ = -ln(0.05)/30. \n\nThen, the probability of at least one event in ten minutes would be 1 - e^(-λ*10). Substituting λ from above: 1 - e^( (ln(0.05)/30)*10 ) = 1 - e^( (ln(0.05)/3) ) = 1 - (e^(ln(0.05)))^(1/3) = 1 - (0.05)^(1/3). Which is the same result as before! So that gives the same answer, approximately 63.2%. \n\nSo both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the probability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes is approximately 63.2%. \n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 0.05^(1/3) more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator, 0.05^(1/3). Let me compute ln(0.05) first. ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957. Then divide by 3: -2.9957 / 3 ≈ -0.9986. Then exponentiate: e^(-0.9986) ≈ e^-1 ≈ 0.3679. So that's about 0.3679, so 1 - 0.3679 ≈ 0.6321, which is 63.21%. \n\nSo that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 63.2%. \n\nBut let me think again: is there another way this could be interpreted? For example, if the probability of seeing a vehicle in each minute is constant and independent, but that might not be the case. However, the Poisson process is a standard model for such events, assuming that the events are independent and occur at a constant average rate. \n\nAlternatively, if someone assumes that the probability is linear, which would be incorrect, but maybe someone might think that if 30 minutes has 95% chance, then 10 minutes would have 95/3 = 31.67% chance. But that's wrong because probabilities don't scale linearly like that. \n\nSo the correct approach is to model it as a Poisson process, leading to the 63.2% probability. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 63.2%, which is 1 - 0.05^(1/3). To express it more precisely, maybe we can write it as 1 - e^{(ln(0.05)/3)} or 1 - (0.05)^{1/3}. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to compute the exact value, let's calculate 0.05^(1/3). Let me use logarithms. \n\nlog10(0.05) = log10(5*10^-2) = log10(5) - 2 ≈ 0.69897 - 2 = -1.30103. Then, divide by 3: -1.30103 / 3 ≈ -0.43368. Then, 10^(-0.43368) ≈ 10^(-0.43) ≈ 10^(-0.43). Since 10^(-0.43) = 10^(0.57 - 1) = 10^0.57 / 10. 10^0.57 is approximately 10^(0.5) * 10^(0.07) ≈ 3.162 * 1.175 ≈ 3.716. Then divide by 10: 0.3716. So that's about 0.3716, so 1 - 0.3716 ≈ 0.6284, which is about 62.84%. \n\nHmm, so depending on the method, it's approximately 62.8% to 63.2%. The exact value would be 1 - 0.05^(1/3). Let me check with a calculator. \n\nIf I compute 0.05^(1/3):\n\nFirst, 0.05 is 5 * 10^-2. Let me compute 5^(1/3) ≈ 1.709975947. Then 10^(-2/3) ≈ 10^(-0.6667) ≈ 0.215443469. Multiplying these together: 1.709975947 * 0.215443469 ≈ 0.3684. Therefore, 1 - 0.3684 ≈ 0.6316, so approximately 63.16%. \n\nSo rounding to two decimal places, that's 63.16%, which is approximately 63.2%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 63.2% chance of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes. \n\nBut let me confirm once more. The key assumption here is that the events are independent in each time interval and that the probability of not seeing a vehicle in each interval is the same. This is the Poisson process assumption, which is a common model for such problems. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is not assuming a Poisson process, but instead a different model, the answer might vary. However, given the information provided, the Poisson process is the standard approach. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if the probability of not seeing a vehicle in 30 minutes is 5%, then the probability of not seeing a vehicle in each 10-minute interval is p, and since there are three such intervals, p^3 = 0.05. Therefore, p = 0.05^(1/3), as before. \n\nYes, that's the same as the Poisson approach. So regardless of the method, the answer is the same. \n\nTherefore, the probability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes is approximately 63.2%.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probability of seeing a vehicle in **10 minutes**, given a **95% chance of seeing one in 30 minutes**, we can model the scenario using a **Poisson process**, which assumes events occur independently at a constant average rate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Define the problem**:  \n   - Let $ P_{30} = 0.95 $ be the probability of seeing **at least one vehicle** in 30 minutes.  \n   - The probability of **not seeing any vehicle** in 30 minutes is $ 1 - P_{30} = 0.05 $.  \n\n2. **Assume independence over time intervals**:  \n   - If the probability of not seeing a vehicle in 10 minutes is $ p $, then over three non-overlapping 10-minute intervals (totaling 30 minutes), the probability of not seeing any vehicle is $ p^3 $.  \n   - Thus, $ p^3 = 0.05 $.  \n\n3. **Solve for $ p $**:  \n   $$\n   p = 0.05^{1/3} \\approx 0.368\n   $$  \n   This means the probability of **not seeing a vehicle** in 10 minutes is ~36.8%.  \n\n4. **Calculate the probability of seeing a vehicle in 10 minutes**:  \n   $$\n   P_{10} = 1 - p = 1 - 0.368 = 0.632 \\quad (\\text{or } 63.2\\%)\n   $$\n\n5. **Alternative derivation using Poisson distribution**:  \n   - The probability of at least one event in time $ t $ is $ 1 - e^{-\\lambda t} $, where $ \\lambda $ is the rate parameter.  \n   - For 30 minutes: $ 1 - e^{-30\\lambda} = 0.95 \\Rightarrow \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{30} $.  \n   - For 10 minutes:  \n     $$\n     P_{10} = 1 - e^{-10\\lambda} = 1 - e^{\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{3}} = 1 - 0.05^{1/3} \\approx 63.2\\%\n     $$\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe probability of seeing a vehicle in **10 minutes** is approximately **63.2%**.  \n\nThis result relies on the assumption of a constant rate and independent events over time, which is standard for such problems.",
