    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this pen problem. So, the pen can write 500 words on average before running out of ink. But there's a twist: the pen writes twice as fast when it's warmer, and that happened during the first 150 words. Now, after writing a 300-word letter, I need to find out how many more words I can write.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total ink usage. Normally, the pen can write 500 words. But the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, which makes it write twice as fast. Wait, does that mean it uses less ink per word during that time? Or does it just write faster but uses the same amount of ink per word?\n\nHmm, the problem says the pen writes twice as fast when warmer. So, if it's writing faster, maybe it's using ink more quickly? Or maybe the speed doesn't affect the ink usage, just the time taken? Wait, but the question is about how much ink is used, not time. So maybe the key is that when the pen is warmer, it uses less ink per word? Or maybe the same amount, but the speed is different?\n\nWait, the problem says the pen can write 500 words on average before running out of ink. So that's the total capacity. But the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, which made it write twice as fast. So, does that mean that during the first 150 words, the pen used less ink per word? Because if it's writing faster, maybe it's using more ink per word? Or maybe the speed is independent of ink usage?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think again. If the pen writes twice as fast when warmer, that might mean that for the same amount of ink, it can write more words. Wait, but the total capacity is 500 words. So maybe the pen's ink usage rate changes based on temperature. If it's warmer, it uses ink more efficiently, so each word uses less ink. Therefore, during the first 150 words, the pen used less ink per word, and then after that, when it's not warmer, it uses more ink per word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed is related to how much ink is used. If the pen writes twice as fast, maybe it uses twice as much ink per word? But that would mean the first 150 words used more ink, which would deplete the pen faster. But the total is 500 words. So maybe the total ink is fixed, and the speed affects how much ink is used per word?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the pen's writing speed affects the rate at which ink is consumed. If it's writing twice as fast, then the ink is being used up at twice the rate. But the total amount of ink is fixed. So, if the pen is used at different rates, the time it takes to run out of ink would vary, but the total words written would depend on the rate.\n\nBut the problem is about how many words can be written, not time. So maybe the total ink is fixed, and the speed affects how much ink is used per word. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me assume that the pen has a total amount of ink that can write 500 words under normal conditions. But when it's warmer, it writes twice as fast. So, if the pen is warmer, it can write more words with the same amount of ink? Or less?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed is independent of ink usage. For example, if the pen is warmer, it can write faster, but each word still uses the same amount of ink. Therefore, the total number of words the pen can write is still 500, regardless of speed. But that seems contradictory to the problem's setup.\n\nWait, the problem says that the pen can write 500 words on average before running out of ink. So that's the total capacity. But the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, which made it write twice as fast. So, perhaps during the first 150 words, the pen used less ink per word, allowing more words to be written later. Or maybe the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pen's ink usage rate is higher when it's warmer. So, if it's writing twice as fast, it's using ink at twice the rate. Therefore, the first 150 words would use more ink, leaving less for the remaining words.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think in terms of ink consumption rate.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet’s assume that under normal conditions, the pen uses a certain amount of ink per word. Let's say the total ink is equivalent to 500 words. So, if the pen is used normally, each word uses 1/500 of the total ink.\n\nBut when the pen is warmer, it writes twice as fast. If writing speed is twice as fast, does that mean that the ink is consumed at twice the rate? So, for the same amount of time, the pen would use twice as much ink. But since the user is writing words, not time, maybe we need to relate the number of words to the ink used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed affects the number of words written per unit time, but the ink usage per word remains the same. Therefore, the total number of words the pen can write is still 500, regardless of speed. But that seems to ignore the temperature effect.\n\nWait, the problem says that the pen writes twice as fast when warmer. So, if the pen is warmer, it can write more words in the same amount of time. But the total ink is fixed. Therefore, if the pen is used at a higher speed, it would deplete the ink faster, but the total number of words would still be 500. But that doesn't make sense because the total ink is fixed. Wait, maybe the total ink is fixed, so the number of words is fixed, regardless of speed. So, if the pen is used at twice the speed, it would take half the time to write the same number of words, but the ink used would be the same. Therefore, the total number of words is still 500, and the speed doesn't affect the total words. But then why does the problem mention the temperature?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the key is that the pen's ink usage rate changes with temperature. If the pen is warmer, it uses less ink per word. Therefore, during the first 150 words, the pen used less ink, allowing more words to be written later. But how do we calculate that?\n\nLet me try to model it with variables.\n\nLet’s assume that the total ink is T. Under normal conditions, the pen can write 500 words, so each word uses T/500 ink.\n\nBut when the pen is warmer, it uses less ink per word. Let's say that when warmer, the ink usage per word is (T/500)/2, because it's twice as fast. Wait, but why would that be? If it's writing twice as fast, maybe it's using ink more efficiently, so each word uses half the ink. Therefore, during the first 150 words, the ink used is 150*(T/500)/2 = 150*T/1000 = 3T/20.\n\nThen, after that, the pen is not warmer, so it uses T/500 per word. The user has already written 300 words. Wait, the user wrote a 300-word letter. Wait, the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, and then the remaining 150 words (from 150 to 300) were written when the pen was not warmer. So, the ink used for the first 150 words is 150*(T/500)/2 = 3T/20, and the ink used for the next 150 words is 150*(T/500) = 3T/10.\n\nTotal ink used so far is 3T/20 + 3T/10 = 3T/20 + 6T/20 = 9T/20.\n\nTherefore, remaining ink is T - 9T/20 = 11T/20.\n\nNow, the user wants to know how many more words can be written. Since after the first 300 words, the pen is not warmer anymore, so it uses T/500 per word. So, the remaining ink is 11T/20, which can write (11T/20) / (T/500) = (11/20)*500 = 275 words.\n\nWait, but the total capacity is 500 words. If the user has already used 300 words, then normally, they would have 200 words left. But according to this calculation, they have 275 words left. That seems contradictory. So, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total ink is fixed, and the temperature affects the rate of ink usage. So, if the pen is warmer, it uses ink faster, but the total number of words is still 500. But that doesn't make sense because the user wrote 300 words already, so there should be 200 left. But the problem says that the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, which might have used more ink, leaving less for the remaining words.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's assume that the pen's ink usage rate is different when it's warmer. Let's say that when the pen is warmer, it uses ink at a rate of r words per unit time, and when it's not warmer, it uses r/2 words per unit time. But the total ink is fixed. However, the user is writing words, not time. So, the total number of words is determined by the total ink divided by the ink per word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pen's ink consumption rate is higher when it's warmer. So, if the pen is warmer, it uses more ink per word. Therefore, writing 150 words when it's warmer would use more ink, leaving less for the remaining words.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's assume that the pen's ink usage per word is different when it's warmer. Let's say that normally, each word uses 1 unit of ink, so total ink is 500 units. When the pen is warmer, each word uses 0.5 units of ink (since it's twice as fast, maybe it's more efficient). Therefore, the first 150 words use 150 * 0.5 = 75 units. Then, the remaining 150 words (from 150 to 300) are written when the pen is not warmer, so each word uses 1 unit, so 150 * 1 = 150 units. Total ink used is 75 + 150 = 225 units. Therefore, remaining ink is 500 - 225 = 275 units. So, the user can write 275 more words. But that would mean that after writing 300 words, there's 275 left, which is more than the original 500 - 300 = 200. That seems odd, but maybe that's the case.\n\nBut why would the pen use less ink when it's warmer? If it's writing faster, maybe it's using more ink per word. For example, if the pen is warmer, the ink flows more easily, so each stroke uses less ink, allowing more words to be written. But that's a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, if the pen is warmer, the ink might be more viscous, requiring more pressure, thus using more ink per word. But the problem states that the pen writes twice as fast when warmer, which might imply that the same amount of ink is used for more words, hence less per word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed is independent of ink usage. The total ink is fixed, so the number of words is fixed. But the temperature affects how quickly the ink is used. However, the user is asking about how many words can be written, not how long it will take. So, regardless of speed, the total number of words is 500. Therefore, after writing 300 words, there are 200 left. But the problem mentions the temperature effect, so that must be relevant.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, which made it write twice as fast, so the user wrote those 150 words in half the time it would take normally. But the ink usage is the same. Therefore, the total ink used for the first 150 words is the same as if they were written normally. Then, the remaining 150 words (from 150 to 300) were written at normal speed, using the same ink per word. Therefore, total ink used is 300 words, so remaining is 200 words. But that doesn't involve the temperature effect, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the temperature affects the total capacity. If the pen is warmer, it can write more words. But the problem says the pen can write 500 words on average. So, maybe the average is considering both warm and normal conditions. But the user wrote 150 words when it was warm, and then the rest at normal. So, the total capacity is 500 words, but the actual usage depends on the temperature.\n\nThis is really tricky. Let me try to look for similar problems or think of it in terms of rates.\n\nLet’s assume that the pen has a total ink capacity of 500 words. When the pen is warmer, it writes twice as fast. Let's define the rate of writing as words per unit time. If the pen is warmer, the rate is 2r, and when it's not, it's r. However, the total ink is fixed, so the amount of ink used per word is the same regardless of speed. Therefore, the total number of words is still 500, and the speed only affects the time taken. Therefore, the user wrote 300 words, so there are 200 left. But the problem mentions the temperature effect, so this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the temperature affects the ink usage rate. If the pen is warmer, it uses ink at a higher rate. So, for the same number of words, more ink is used when the pen is warmer. Therefore, writing 150 words when the pen is warmer would use more ink than writing 150 words when it's not. Therefore, the total ink used for the first 150 words is higher, leaving less for the remaining words.\n\nLet’s model this with rates. Let’s say that the pen's ink usage rate is k words per unit ink. Wait, that might not be the right way. Let me think in terms of time.\n\nLet’s assume that the pen can write at a rate of r words per minute when it's not warm, and 2r words per minute when it's warm. The total ink is such that at rate r, it can write 500 words. So, the total time to write 500 words at rate r is 500/r minutes. The total ink used is proportional to the time multiplied by the rate? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if the pen is writing at rate r words per minute, then the ink usage rate would be some value, say, c units of ink per minute. Therefore, total ink is c * (500/r) = total ink.\n\nBut if the pen is warmer, it writes at 2r words per minute, but the ink usage rate might be different. If the pen is warmer, maybe the ink usage rate is higher. For example, if the pen is warmer, it uses more ink per minute, so even though it writes more words per minute, the total ink used per word might be the same or different.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem is intended to be simpler. Let's think about it as the first 150 words were written when the pen was warmer, which made it write twice as fast. So, the user wrote 150 words in the time it would normally take to write 75 words. Therefore, the ink used for those 150 words is the same as 75 words normally. Then, the remaining 150 words (from 150 to 300) were written at normal speed, using 150 words worth of ink. So total ink used is 75 + 150 = 225 words worth of ink. Therefore, remaining ink is 500 - 225 = 275 words. So, the user can write 275 more words.\n\nThis seems to be a common approach in similar problems where speed affects the amount of resource used. For example, if you walk twice as fast, you cover the same distance in half the time, but the energy used might be different. But in this case, the assumption is that writing twice as fast uses half the ink per word, which might not be accurate, but it's a possible interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if writing twice as fast means that the pen uses twice as much ink per word, then the first 150 words would use 150*2 = 300 units of ink, and the next 150 words would use 150 units, totaling 450, leaving 50 words. But that would be 50 words left, which is less than the original 200. But this depends on the assumption.\n\nThe problem is ambiguous in terms of how the temperature affects ink usage. However, the most common interpretation in such problems is that if something works twice as fast, it uses half the resource per unit of output. So, in this case, writing twice as fast would mean that each word uses half the ink. Therefore, the first 150 words use 150/2 = 75 units, and the next 150 use 150 units, totaling 225, leaving 275. Therefore, the answer is 275 words.\n\nBut I need to check if this makes sense. If the pen can write 500 words normally, and the first 150 words were written with half the ink per word, then the total ink used for those 150 words is 75, and the remaining 350 words would normally use 350 units. But since the user only wrote 300 words, the remaining ink is 500 - 225 = 275, which is more than the 200 that would be left if all 300 words were written normally. This seems to be the case, and it's a possible answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the temperature doesn't affect the ink usage, then the answer is 200 words. But the problem mentions the temperature effect, so the answer must involve that. Therefore, the answer is 275 words.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more words can be written with the pen after writing 300 words, we need to account for the temperature-dependent ink usage. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Ink Capacity**: The pen can write **500 words** on average before running out of ink. This implies the total ink is equivalent to 500 words under normal conditions.\n\n2. **Temperature Effect**: The pen writes **twice as fast** when warmer. This suggests that during the first 150 words (when the pen was warmer), **each word used half the ink** compared to normal conditions. Thus:\n   - **First 150 words**: $150 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 75$ units of ink used.\n   - **Next 150 words (150–300)**: Written at normal speed, using $150 \\times 1 = 150$ units of ink.\n\n3. **Total Ink Used So Far**: $75 + 150 = 225$ units of ink.\n\n4. **Remaining Ink**: $500 - 225 = 275$ units of ink.\n\n5. **Words Remaining**: Since the pen is now at normal speed (after the first 150 words), the remaining ink can write **275 words**.\n\n**Answer**: You can write **275 more words** with the pen. \n\n**Key Assumption**: The temperature effect reduces ink usage per word when the pen is warmer (i.e., writing twice as fast uses half the ink per word). This interpretation aligns with common problem-solving frameworks where increased speed implies reduced resource consumption per unit of output.",
