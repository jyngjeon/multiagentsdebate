    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is: Ankur's brother has two children, and one of them is a boy born on Tuesday. What's the probability that both children are boys? The assumptions are that the chance of having a boy or girl is equal, and the day of birth is equally likely to be any day of the week.\n\nHmm, I remember similar problems before, like the classic \"two children, one is a boy, what's the probability both are boys?\" The answer there is 1/3, right? Because there are four possible combinations for two children: BB, BG, GB, GG. Since we know one is a boy, GG is out, leaving three possibilities, each equally likely. But wait, in that case, BG and GB are considered different, so the probability of BB is 1/3.\n\nBut here, there's an added detail about the day of the week. So, the problem is more specific. The boy was born on Tuesday. How does that affect the probability?\n\nLet me think. Maybe the day of the week adds more information, which changes the sample space. Let me try to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider all possible combinations of two children, considering both gender and day of birth. Each child can be a boy or a girl, and each has a day of birth from Monday to Sunday. So, for each child, there are 2 * 7 = 14 possibilities. For two children, that's 14 * 14 = 196 total possibilities.\n\nBut we have the condition that at least one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday. So, we need to count how many of these 196 possibilities satisfy that condition, and then how many of those have both children as boys.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"one of the boys was born on Tuesday.\" So, does that mean exactly one boy, or at least one boy? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. But in probability problems, usually, \"one of the boys\" implies that there is at least one boy, and the information is that one of them is a boy born on Tuesday. So, similar to the classic problem but with more specific information.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that. So, the sample space is all possible pairs of children, each with gender and day of birth. The condition is that at least one is a boy born on Tuesday. We need to find the probability that both are boys given this condition.\n\nSo, first, let's compute the total number of possible cases where at least one child is a boy born on Tuesday. Then, the number of those cases where both are boys.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of cases where at least one child is a boy born on Tuesday. To do this, it's easier to calculate the total number of cases where at least one is a boy born on Tuesday, which is equal to total cases minus cases where neither child is a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nTotal cases: 14 * 14 = 196.\n\nNumber of cases where neither child is a boy born on Tuesday: For each child, the number of possibilities where they are not a boy born on Tuesday. Each child can be a girl (7 days) or a boy not born on Tuesday (6 days). So, 7 + 6 = 13 possibilities per child. Therefore, 13 * 13 = 169.\n\nTherefore, the number of cases where at least one child is a boy born on Tuesday is 196 - 169 = 27.\n\nWait, but that seems low. Let me check again. Wait, 14 possibilities per child. If we want the number of cases where at least one is a boy born on Tuesday, that's equal to the number of cases where the first child is a boy born on Tuesday plus the number where the second child is a boy born on Tuesday minus the cases where both are boys born on Tuesday (to avoid double-counting).\n\nSo, first child is a boy born on Tuesday: 1 possibility for the first child, 14 for the second: 1*14 = 14.\n\nSecond child is a boy born on Tuesday: 14*1 = 14.\n\nBut then subtract the overlap where both are boys born on Tuesday: 1*1 = 1.\n\nSo total is 14 + 14 - 1 = 27. Yes, same as before. So 27 cases where at least one child is a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nNow, how many of these 27 cases have both children as boys?\n\nLet's compute that. So, the cases where both are boys, and at least one is born on Tuesday.\n\nSo, first, the total number of cases where both are boys: each child has 7 days, so 7*7 = 49 possibilities.\n\nNow, how many of these 49 have at least one boy born on Tuesday?\n\nAgain, similar to before: total cases where both are boys minus cases where neither is born on Tuesday.\n\nNumber of cases where both are boys and neither is born on Tuesday: each boy can be born on any day except Tuesday, so 6 days per child. So 6*6 = 36.\n\nTherefore, the number of cases where both are boys and at least one is born on Tuesday is 49 - 36 = 13.\n\nWait, but earlier we had 27 total cases where at least one is a boy born on Tuesday. So, the probability would be 13/27?\n\nBut wait, that seems different from the classic problem. In the classic problem without the day of the week, the probability was 1/3. Here, with the day of the week, it's 13/27. That seems counterintuitive. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the information is given as \"one of the boys was born on Tuesday,\" which might be different from \"at least one boy was born on Tuesday.\" Wait, but in the problem statement, it's stated as \"one of the boy was born on Tuesday.\" Wait, the original problem says \"one of the boy was born on Tuesday.\" Wait, maybe that's a typo. It should be \"one of the boys was born on Tuesday.\" Assuming that's the case.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to the classic problem but with more specific information. The addition of the day of the week changes the probability because it adds more information, which reduces the sample space in a way that affects the probability.\n\nBut let me think again. Let's model all possibilities.\n\nEach child can be represented as (gender, day). So, for two children, we have ordered pairs ((G1, D1), (G2, D2)).\n\nThe condition is that at least one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday. So, the sample space is all such ordered pairs where at least one is (B, Tue).\n\nNow, the question is: given that, what is the probability that both are boys?\n\nSo, the number of favorable cases is the number of ordered pairs where both are boys and at least one is born on Tuesday. The total number of cases is the number of ordered pairs where at least one is a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier, I calculated that as 27 total cases and 13 favorable. So 13/27.\n\nBut let me check that again. Let's think of the total number of cases where at least one is a boy born on Tuesday. How many are there?\n\nAs before, 27. Now, how many of those have both boys?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nCase 1: First child is a boy born on Tuesday, second child is any.\n\nCase 2: Second child is a boy born on Tuesday, first child is any.\n\nBut then subtract the overlap where both are boys born on Tuesday.\n\nSo, for case 1: first child is (B, Tue), second child can be anything: 1 * 14 = 14.\n\nCase 2: second child is (B, Tue), first child can be anything: 14 * 1 = 14.\n\nOverlap: both are (B, Tue): 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo total is 14 + 14 - 1 = 27, as before.\n\nNow, how many of these 27 cases have both children as boys?\n\nIn case 1: first child is (B, Tue), second child can be anything. How many of these have the second child as a boy? The second child can be any of 14 possibilities, but we want the second child to be a boy. There are 7 possibilities for the second child being a boy (any day). So, in case 1, the number of cases where both are boys is 1 * 7 = 7.\n\nSimilarly, in case 2: second child is (B, Tue), first child can be anything. The number of cases where the first child is a boy is 7 possibilities. So, 7 * 1 = 7.\n\nBut now, the overlap where both are (B, Tue) is counted in both case 1 and case 2. So, when we add 7 + 7, we have counted the case where both are (B, Tue) twice. Therefore, we need to subtract it once.\n\nSo, total number of favorable cases is 7 + 7 - 1 = 13. Which matches the previous calculation. Therefore, 13/27 is the probability.\n\nBut wait, in the classic problem without the day of the week, the probability was 1/3. Here, with the day of the week, it's 13/27 ≈ 0.481, which is slightly less than 1/2. That seems interesting. So, adding more specific information (the day of the week) actually changes the probability from 1/3 to 13/27. That seems to be a known result in probability puzzles.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's think of all possible cases where there is at least one boy born on Tuesday. How many of those have two boys?\n\nAlternatively, think of the possible combinations:\n\nIf the two children are both boys, then the number of ways that at least one is born on Tuesday is 13, as calculated.\n\nIf one is a boy and one is a girl, then the number of cases where the boy is born on Tuesday. Let's calculate that.\n\nFor the case where one is a boy and one is a girl. There are two possibilities: first child is a boy and second is a girl, or first is a girl and second is a boy. But since we are considering ordered pairs, we can calculate each.\n\nBut in this case, the boy must be born on Tuesday. So, for the case where the first child is a boy born on Tuesday and the second is a girl (any day): 1 * 7 = 7.\n\nSimilarly, the case where the first child is a girl (any day) and the second is a boy born on Tuesday: 7 * 1 = 7.\n\nSo, total of 14 cases where there is exactly one boy (born on Tuesday) and one girl.\n\nAdditionally, the case where both are boys and at least one is born on Tuesday: 13 cases.\n\nSo, total cases where at least one boy born on Tuesday is 13 + 14 = 27, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both are boys is 13/27.\n\nBut wait, in the classic problem, the probability was 1/3. Here, with the added information of the day of the week, it's 13/27. That seems to be because the added information reduces the sample space in a way that makes the probability closer to 1/2. But why?\n\nBecause when you specify a particular day, you're effectively narrowing down the possibilities more. For example, if you had said \"one of the boys was born on a Monday,\" the probability would be similar, 13/27. But if you had said \"one of the boys was born on a Monday or Tuesday,\" the probability would be different.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"at least one boy,\" without specifying the day, then the probability would be 1/3. But with the day specified, it's different.\n\nSo, the answer here is 13/27.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Let's use conditional probability.\n\nLet A be the event that both children are boys.\n\nLet B be the event that at least one child is a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nWe need to find P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B).\n\nFirst, compute P(B). As before, total cases 196. Number of cases where at least one is a boy born on Tuesday is 27. So P(B) = 27/196.\n\nP(A and B) is the probability that both are boys and at least one is born on Tuesday. As calculated earlier, that's 13/196.\n\nTherefore, P(A | B) = (13/196) / (27/196) = 13/27. Same result.\n\nSo that seems to confirm it.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: if we consider that the information given is that one of the boys was born on Tuesday, which might be interpreted as \"there is a boy, and he was born on Tuesday.\" But in that case, the problem might be different. Wait, but in probability, the way the information is obtained matters. If the person is telling you that one of the boys was born on Tuesday, it's similar to the classic problem where the information is obtained by checking one child.\n\nBut in the classic problem, if you know that at least one is a boy, the probability is 1/3. But if you know that a specific child (e.g., the older one) is a boy, the probability is 1/2. So, the way the information is obtained affects the probability.\n\nIn this problem, the information is that \"one of the boys was born on Tuesday.\" If this is equivalent to \"at least one boy was born on Tuesday,\" then the probability is 13/27. But if the information is obtained by selecting a child at random and finding out that it's a boy born on Tuesday, then the probability might be different.\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. The way the information is obtained can change the probability. For example, if someone is asked, \"Do you have at least one boy born on Tuesday?\" and they say yes, that's different from if they are asked to name one of their children, and they happen to name a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nIn the original problem, the exact wording is important. The problem says, \"Ankur's brother has two offsprings and one of the boy was born on Tuesday.\" The phrasing \"one of the boy\" might be a typo, but assuming it's \"one of the boys,\" then it's similar to the classic problem where the information is that at least one is a boy born on Tuesday.\n\nBut if the information was obtained by randomly selecting one of the children and finding out that it's a boy born on Tuesday, then the probability would be different. For example, if you randomly pick one child and it's a boy born on Tuesday, then the probability that the other is a boy is different.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how the information was obtained. However, in most probability problems like this, unless specified otherwise, it's assumed that the information is that at least one child meets the condition. So, the answer would be 13/27.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose we model the problem as follows:\n\nEach child has a 50% chance of being a boy or girl, and 1/7 chance of being born on any day.\n\nThe probability that both are boys is 1/4. The probability that at least one is a boy born on Tuesday is 27/196 as calculated.\n\nBut the conditional probability is 13/27.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of the problem as: given that one of the children is a boy born on Tuesday, what is the probability that both are boys?\n\nThis is similar to the classic problem but with more specific information. The addition of the day of the week adds more constraints, which changes the probability.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the day of the week acts as a way to distinguish between the two children. In the classic problem, without the day, the probability is 1/3 because there are three possibilities: BB, BG, GB. But with the day, the information is more specific, so the probability changes.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that specifying the day of the week reduces the number of possible cases where the information could be true, thereby affecting the probability.\n\nSo, after going through all these calculations and checking different approaches, I think the answer is 13/27.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that Ankur's brother has two boys, given that one of his children is a boy born on Tuesday, is **13/27**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Possible Cases**:  \n   Each child has 2 genders (boy/girl) and 7 days of birth, giving **14 possibilities per child**. For two children, there are **14 × 14 = 196** total combinations.\n\n2. **Condition**:  \n   At least one child is a **boy born on Tuesday**.  \n   - **Total cases with at least one boy born on Tuesday**:  \n     - First child is a boy born on Tuesday: **1 × 14 = 14**.  \n     - Second child is a boy born on Tuesday: **14 × 1 = 14**.  \n     - Subtract overlap (both children are boys born on Tuesday): **1**.  \n     - **Total = 14 + 14 − 1 = 27**.\n\n3. **Favorable Cases (Both Children Are Boys)**:  \n   - Total cases where both are boys: **7 × 7 = 49** (each boy has 7 days).  \n   - Subtract cases where **neither** is born on Tuesday: **6 × 6 = 36** (each boy has 6 days excluding Tuesday).  \n   - **Favorable cases = 49 − 36 = 13**.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**:  \n   - **P(Both boys | At least one boy born on Tuesday)** = **13/27**.\n\nThis result differs from the classic \"two boys\" problem (1/3) because specifying the day of the week adds more information, narrowing the sample space and altering the probability. The answer **13/27** reflects the increased specificity of the condition. \n\n**Answer:**  \n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{27}}\n$$",
