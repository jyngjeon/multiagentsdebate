    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many times Circle A revolves as it rolls around Circle B. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about rolling without slipping. When a circle rolls without slipping along a straight line, the number of revolutions it makes is equal to the distance traveled divided by its circumference. But here, instead of a straight line, it's rolling around another circle. Hmm, that might be different.\n\nFirst, let me note the radii. Let's say the radius of Circle B is R, so the radius of Circle A is R/3. Since they are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is R + R/3 = (4R)/3. Now, if Circle A rolls around Circle B without slipping, the path that the center of Circle A takes is a circle with radius equal to the distance between the centers, which is (4R)/3. So the circumference of this path is 2π*(4R/3) = (8πR)/3.\n\nIf there were no rotation due to going around the circle, just moving along a straight line, the number of revolutions would be the distance divided by the circumference of Circle A. The circumference of Circle A is 2π*(R/3) = (2πR)/3. So (8πR/3) divided by (2πR/3) is 4. So that would be 4 revolutions. But wait, that's just if it's moving along a straight line. However, when it goes around a circle, there's an additional rotation because the center is moving along a circular path. \n\nWait, I remember that when a circle rolls around another circle, the number of rotations is related to the ratio of their circumferences. For example, if a circle rolls around another circle of the same radius, it makes 2 rotations. But I need to think carefully here. \n\nLet me think of the case where a circle rolls around another circle externally. The total rotation is the rotation due to the path length plus the rotation due to the orbital motion. Wait, maybe it's the other way around. When you roll around a circle, the number of rotations is (circumference of path / circumference of rolling circle) plus 1? Or minus 1? \n\nWait, let me think of a simple case. If you have a coin rolling around another coin of the same size without slipping. If you roll it around the outside, how many rotations does it make? I think it's 2. Because the circumference of the path is 2π*(2R) = 4πR, and the circumference of the coin is 2πR, so 4πR / 2πR = 2. But when you actually do this with coins, it makes 2 rotations. But wait, if you roll it around the outside, the center moves along a circle of radius 2R, so the distance is 2π*(2R) = 4πR. Divided by the circumference of the coin, which is 2πR, gives 2. But when you do it physically, you see that the coin makes 2 full rotations. So that seems to check out. \n\nBut in that case, the answer is 2. However, if you roll it around the inside, it's different. For example, if you have a coin rolling inside another coin of the same radius, it makes 0 rotations? No, actually, it makes 1 rotation in the opposite direction. Wait, maybe that's different. \n\nBut in our problem, it's rolling externally. So if the radius of Circle A is 1/3 of Circle B, then the ratio of their radii is 1:3. So the circumference of Circle B is 2πR, and Circle A is 2π(R/3). \n\nSo the path that the center of Circle A takes is a circle with radius R + R/3 = 4R/3. The circumference of that path is 2π*(4R/3) = 8πR/3. \n\nIf we divide that by the circumference of Circle A, which is 2π(R/3) = 2πR/3, we get (8πR/3) / (2πR/3) = 4. So that would be 4 revolutions. But wait, in the case where the radii are equal, we saw that the answer was 2, but according to this formula, if the radius of the rolling circle is equal to the fixed circle, then the path circumference would be 2π*(2R) = 4πR, divided by 2πR gives 2, which matches. So that seems to work. \n\nBut then why do I remember sometimes that when you roll around a circle, you have to add 1 or subtract 1? Maybe that's when considering the rotation of the center. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the circle is rolling around another circle. The total rotation of the rolling circle is due to two things: the rotation from moving along the path, and the rotation from going around the fixed circle. Wait, but when you roll without slipping, the rotation is entirely determined by the distance traveled. However, when you go around a circle, the direction of rotation might be different. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is (circumference of path / circumference of rolling circle) + 1? But in the case of equal radii, that would be 2 + 1 = 3, which contradicts the known result of 2. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (circumference of path / circumference of rolling circle) - 1? For equal radii, that would be 2 - 1 = 1, which is also wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the rotation of the center. When the circle rolls around the fixed circle, the center moves along a circular path. The rotation of the rolling circle is due to both the translation along the path and the rotation caused by the orbital motion. \n\nWait, but in the case of rolling without slipping, the rotation is entirely determined by the distance traveled. If the center moves along a path of length L, then the number of rotations is L / (2πr), where r is the radius of the rolling circle. \n\nBut in the case of the coin rolling around another coin, the distance traveled by the center is 2π(R + r), where R is the radius of the fixed circle and r is the radius of the rolling circle. Then the number of rotations would be [2π(R + r)] / (2πr) = (R + r)/r = 1 + R/r. \n\nWait, so if R = r, then it's 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the known result. If R is 3r, then it would be 1 + 3r/r = 4. So in our problem, since R is the radius of Circle B, and Circle A has radius r = R/3, then substituting R = 3r, the number of rotations would be 1 + 3r/r = 4. So that gives 4. \n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict some other thoughts I had. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, if the circle is rolling on the outside, the formula is (R + r)/r = 1 + R/r. If it's rolling on the inside, it's (R - r)/r = R/r - 1. \n\nSo in our case, since it's rolling externally, the formula would be 1 + R/r. Since R is the radius of the fixed circle, and r is the radius of the rolling circle. \n\nGiven that r = R/3, then R/r = 3. So 1 + 3 = 4. Therefore, the answer is 4. \n\nBut I remember that when you have a coin rolling around another coin of the same size, it makes 2 rotations, which matches 1 + 1 = 2. So that seems correct. \n\nBut then why do some people say that when you roll around a circle, you have to add 1? Maybe that's the case here. \n\nWait, but let me think of another way. Imagine unrolling the path. If the circle rolls along a straight line equal in length to the circumference of the path, then the number of rotations would be the length divided by the circumference of the circle. But in this case, the path is a circle, so the length is 2π(R + r). \n\nBut when you roll around a circle, the direction of rotation is such that the rotation of the circle is both due to moving along the path and the rotation caused by going around the fixed circle. Wait, but in reality, the rotation is entirely determined by the distance traveled. \n\nWait, but if you have a circle rolling around another circle, the total rotation is the rotation from the path length plus the rotation from the orbital motion. Wait, but that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, think about the point of contact. When the circle rolls without slipping, the arc length that is in contact with the fixed circle must be equal to the arc length that the rolling circle rotates. \n\nBut since the circles are externally tangent, the rolling circle is moving around the fixed circle. So as it goes around, the center moves along a circle of radius R + r. \n\nThe total angle that the center moves around is 2π radians. The rotation of the rolling circle is such that the point of contact moves along the fixed circle. \n\nBut the distance that the rolling circle's center moves is 2π(R + r). The number of rotations would be that distance divided by the circumference of the rolling circle, which is 2πr. So (2π(R + r)) / (2πr) = (R + r)/r = 1 + R/r. \n\nSo that gives the same result as before. Therefore, if R is 3r, then 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nBut let me check with a different example. Suppose the rolling circle is much smaller, say r approaches zero. Then the number of rotations would approach infinity, which makes sense because the path is almost the circumference of the fixed circle, and the small circle would have to rotate many times. \n\nAlternatively, if the rolling circle is the same size as the fixed circle, then R = r, so 1 + 1 = 2, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, in our problem, since R is 3r, the answer is 4. \n\nBut wait, I've heard before that when a circle rolls around another circle, the number of rotations is (R + r)/r, but sometimes people say it's (R/r) + 1. Which is the same thing. So that seems to be the formula. \n\nBut then why do some sources say that when a circle rolls around another circle, the number of rotations is (R/r) + 1? For example, if you have a coin rolling around another coin of the same size, it makes 2 rotations, which is 1 + 1. So that seems to fit. \n\nTherefore, in our case, since R is 3r, the answer is 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember a similar problem where a coin rolls around another coin of the same size and makes 2 rotations, but if you just do the math, the distance traveled is 2π*(2R) = 4πR, and the circumference of the coin is 2πR, so 4πR / 2πR = 2. So that's the same as the formula. \n\nTherefore, in our problem, the answer should be 4. \n\nBut let me think again. Suppose the radius of Circle B is 3 units, so Circle A is 1 unit. The center of Circle A moves along a circle of radius 3 + 1 = 4 units. The circumference of that path is 2π*4 = 8π. The circumference of Circle A is 2π*1 = 2π. So 8π / 2π = 4. So that's 4 rotations. \n\nBut wait, when you actually do this with coins, does it make 4 rotations? Let me try to visualize. If you have a small coin rolling around a larger coin, say, three times as big. If you roll it around the outside, how many times does it rotate? \n\nImagine starting with the small coin touching the large coin at the bottom. As it rolls around, the small coin has to rotate both because it's moving around the large coin and because it's rotating on its own axis. \n\nBut if the center moves along a circle of circumference 8π, and the coin's circumference is 2π, then 4 rotations. But when you actually do this, does it make 4 rotations? \n\nAlternatively, think of the rotation as the angle of rotation of the coin. The total rotation angle of the coin is equal to the angle swept by the center around the fixed circle plus the rotation due to the rolling. Wait, no. \n\nWait, when the coin rolls without slipping, the rotation of the coin is determined by the distance traveled. The rotation angle θ (in radians) is equal to the arc length traveled divided by the radius of the coin. \n\nThe arc length traveled by the center is 2π(R + r). So θ = 2π(R + r)/r. \n\nBut θ is also equal to the number of rotations times 2π. So number of rotations N = θ / (2π) = [2π(R + r)/r] / (2π) = (R + r)/r = 1 + R/r. \n\nSo that's the same as before. Therefore, N = 1 + R/r. \n\nIn our case, R = 3r, so N = 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4. \n\nBut I remember another way to think about it. If you have a circle rolling around another circle, the number of rotations is the ratio of the circumferences plus 1. Wait, but the ratio of the circumferences is (2πR)/(2πr) = R/r. So adding 1 gives 1 + R/r. Which is the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 4. \n\nBut I want to make sure there isn't a different approach. For example, sometimes when you have gears, the rotation is different. But in this case, it's not a gear, it's just rolling without slipping. \n\nAlternatively, think about the rotation of the point of contact. When the circle rolls around, the point of contact moves along the fixed circle. The arc length that the rolling circle must rotate is equal to the arc length along the fixed circle. \n\nBut the fixed circle has a circumference of 2πR. The rolling circle has to rotate such that the arc length it rolls over is equal to the arc length on the fixed circle. However, since it's going around the entire fixed circle, the total arc length is 2πR. \n\nBut the rolling circle's rotation would be 2πR / (2πr) = R/r. But that would be 3. However, we also have the rotation due to going around the fixed circle. Wait, but if the center moves around the fixed circle once, that's an additional rotation? \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again. \n\nIf the rolling circle goes around the fixed circle once, the center moves through an angle of 2π radians. If the rolling circle were just rotating around the fixed circle without rolling, it would have to rotate once in the opposite direction. But since it's rolling without slipping, the rotation is a combination of both. \n\nBut how does that combine? \n\nLet me think of the rotation of the rolling circle. The total rotation is the rotation due to the rolling motion plus the rotation due to the orbital motion. \n\nWait, but in reality, the rotation is entirely determined by the rolling without slipping condition. The rotation of the rolling circle is such that the arc length it rolls over is equal to the arc length along the path. \n\nBut the path is the circumference of the circle that the center moves along, which is 2π(R + r). Therefore, the number of rotations is 2π(R + r) / (2πr) = (R + r)/r = 1 + R/r. \n\nSo that's the same as before. Therefore, the answer is 4. \n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because I remember that when you have a coin rolling around another coin, the number of rotations is (R + r)/r, which is 4 in this case. \n\nAlternatively, if you have a coin rolling on the inside, it's (R - r)/r. So if R = 3r, then (3r - r)/r = 2. So that would be 2 rotations. \n\nBut in our problem, it's externally tangent, so it's the external case, which is (R + r)/r. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4. \n\nBut let me check with a different approach. Suppose we parameterize the motion. Let's say the center of Circle B is at the origin, and Circle A starts at the point (R + r, 0). As Circle A rolls around Circle B, the center of Circle A moves along a circle of radius R + r. \n\nLet’s consider the angle θ that the center of Circle A has moved around Circle B. The position of the center of Circle A is ( (R + r) cos θ, (R + r) sin θ ). \n\nNow, the rotation of Circle A is such that the point of contact between the two circles is instantaneously at rest relative to Circle B. \n\nThe rotation of Circle A is determined by the angle that the center has moved around Circle B. Let’s denote the rotation angle of Circle A as φ. \n\nSince there is no slipping, the arc length that Circle A has rolled over must equal the arc length along Circle B. \n\nThe arc length along Circle B is R * θ. \n\nThe arc length that Circle A has rolled over is r * φ. \n\nBut since they are externally tangent, the direction of rotation of Circle A is such that the arc lengths are equal. However, as Circle A goes around Circle B, the rotation of Circle A is in the same direction as the orbital motion. \n\nWait, but if the center moves around Circle B by angle θ, then the rotation of Circle A must be such that the point of contact moves along Circle B. \n\nBut the total rotation of Circle A is φ = θ * (R / r) + something? \n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. \n\nIf the center moves by angle θ, then the point of contact on Circle B has moved by an arc length of Rθ. The same arc length must be covered by the rotation of Circle A. However, since Circle A is rolling around the outside, the rotation of Circle A is in the same direction as the orbital motion. \n\nTherefore, the rotation angle φ of Circle A is such that rφ = Rθ. Therefore, φ = (R/r)θ. \n\nBut when the center completes a full circle, θ = 2π. Therefore, φ = (R/r)(2π). \n\nBut the number of rotations is φ / (2π) = R/r. \n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous result. According to this, the number of rotations would be R/r, which in our case is 3. But earlier calculations said 4. \n\nSo which is correct? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me check with the case where R = r. If R = r, then according to this, φ = (R/r)θ = θ. So when θ = 2π, φ = 2π, which is 1 rotation. But we know that when a coin rolls around another coin of the same size, it makes 2 rotations. So this approach is giving the wrong answer. \n\nTherefore, there must be an error in this reasoning. \n\nWhere is the mistake? \n\nAh, perhaps the arc length that Circle A rolls over is not just Rθ. Because when the center moves around the circle, the point of contact is not just moving along the fixed circle. Wait, but if there's no slipping, the arc length that Circle A rolls over should equal the arc length on Circle B. \n\nWait, but if the center moves by angle θ, then the point of contact on Circle B has moved by an arc length of Rθ. However, the arc length that Circle A has rolled over is rφ. Therefore, rφ = Rθ. Therefore, φ = (R/r)θ. \n\nBut when θ = 2π, φ = (R/r)(2π). Therefore, the number of rotations is φ/(2π) = R/r. \n\nBut in the case where R = r, this gives 1 rotation, but we know it should be 2. \n\nSo clearly, this approach is missing something. \n\nWhat's the problem here? \n\nAh! Because when the circle rolls around the fixed circle, the rotation of the circle is not only due to the rolling over the fixed circle but also due to the rotation of the center around the fixed circle. \n\nWait, but in the previous calculation, we considered that the rotation of the circle is φ = (R/r)θ. However, if the center is moving around the fixed circle, the rotation of the circle is also affected by the orbital motion. \n\nWait, maybe the total rotation of the circle is the rotation due to rolling plus the rotation due to the orbital motion. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think of the rotation of the circle as a combination of two motions: the rotation about its own center and the rotation about the center of the fixed circle. \n\nBut in reality, the rotation of the circle is only about its own center. The orbital motion is just the movement of the center. \n\nBut the no-slip condition relates the rotation of the circle to the movement of the center. \n\nWait, perhaps the error is in assuming that the arc length rolled over is Rθ. But actually, the center moves along a circle of radius R + r, so the distance traveled by the center is (R + r)θ. \n\nBut the arc length that the rolling circle must roll over is equal to the distance traveled by the center? No, that's not correct. \n\nWait, when a circle rolls without slipping on a straight line, the distance traveled by the center is equal to the arc length rolled over. But when it's rolling on a curved path, like a circle, the relationship is different. \n\nWait, in the case of rolling on a straight line, the distance the center moves is equal to the arc length rolled over. But when rolling on a curved path, the arc length rolled over is equal to the arc length along the path. \n\nBut in this case, the path is the circumference of the circle that the center moves along, which is 2π(R + r). Therefore, the arc length rolled over is 2π(R + r), which would give the number of rotations as 2π(R + r)/(2πr) = (R + r)/r = 1 + R/r. \n\nBut earlier, when I tried to relate the rotation angle φ to the angle θ, I got φ = (R/r)θ, which gave a different answer. \n\nSo why the discrepancy? \n\nAh, because in that approach, I was assuming that the arc length rolled over is equal to the arc length on the fixed circle, which is Rθ. But that's not the case. The arc length that the rolling circle must roll over is not the arc length on the fixed circle, but the arc length along the path that the center takes. \n\nWait, but if there is no slipping, the arc length that the rolling circle rolls over should be equal to the arc length along the surface it's rolling on. But in this case, the surface is the fixed circle. However, the rolling circle is not rolling on the fixed circle's surface, but rather, it's rolling around it. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again. \n\nWhen two circles are externally tangent and rolling without slipping, the point of contact is instantaneously at rest relative to the fixed circle. Therefore, the arc length that the rolling circle has rolled over must equal the arc length that the fixed circle has \"unrolled\" at the point of contact. \n\nBut as the rolling circle goes around the fixed circle, the point of contact moves along the fixed circle. Therefore, the arc length on the fixed circle is Rθ, and the arc length on the rolling circle is rφ. Therefore, Rθ = rφ. \n\nBut if the center of the rolling circle moves around the fixed circle by angle θ, then the center has moved along an arc of length (R + r)θ. \n\nBut how does this relate to the rotation of the rolling circle? \n\nWait, if the rolling circle is rotating such that the arc length on the fixed circle is Rθ, then the rotation of the rolling circle is φ = (R/r)θ. \n\nBut the center has moved along an arc of length (R + r)θ. \n\nBut the distance the center moves is also equal to the arc length rolled over by the rolling circle, which is rφ. \n\nWait, but if the rolling circle is rolling on the fixed circle, then the distance the center moves should be equal to the arc length rolled over. \n\nBut that would mean (R + r)θ = rφ. \n\nBut earlier, we had Rθ = rφ. \n\nSo which is correct? \n\nThis is the crux of the confusion. \n\nLet me think of a simple case where R = r. If the rolling circle rolls around the fixed circle, then according to the first equation, Rθ = rφ => rθ = rφ => φ = θ. So when θ = 2π, φ = 2π, which is 1 rotation. But we know that it should be 2 rotations. \n\nAccording to the second equation, (R + r)θ = rφ => 2rθ = rφ => φ = 2θ. So when θ = 2π, φ = 4π, which is 2 rotations. That matches the known result. \n\nSo which equation is correct? \n\nThe second equation seems to be correct. So why is that? \n\nBecause the distance the center moves is equal to the arc length rolled over by the rolling circle. \n\nBut if the rolling circle is rolling on the fixed circle, then the distance the center moves is equal to the arc length rolled over. \n\nWait, but if the rolling circle is rolling on the fixed circle, then the arc length rolled over is the same as the distance the center moves? \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. When a circle rolls on a straight line, the distance the center moves is equal to the arc length rolled over. But when it rolls on a curved surface, like another circle, the relationship is different. \n\nWait, but in this case, the rolling circle is not rolling on the fixed circle's surface, but rather, it's rolling around it. The point of contact is moving along the fixed circle, but the center is moving along a larger circle. \n\nSo the distance the center moves is (R + r)θ, and the arc length rolled over by the rolling circle is rφ. \n\nBut since there is no slipping, these two should be equal? \n\nWait, but in the case of rolling on a straight line, the distance the center moves is equal to the arc length rolled over. So in that case, yes. \n\nBut when rolling on a curved path, is the same true? \n\nYes, because the no-slip condition means that the arc length that the rolling circle has rolled over is equal to the distance the center has moved. \n\nWait, but that can't be, because if you roll a circle around another circle, the distance the center moves is longer than the arc length on the fixed circle. \n\nBut according to the no-slip condition, the arc length that the rolling circle rolls over should be equal to the arc length on the surface it's rolling on. \n\nBut in this case, the surface is the fixed circle. So the arc length on the fixed circle is Rθ, and the arc length on the rolling circle is rφ. Therefore, Rθ = rφ. \n\nBut this contradicts the previous idea that the distance the center moves is equal to the arc length rolled over. \n\nSo which is correct? \n\nLet me think of a simple example. Suppose the rolling circle rolls around the fixed circle without slipping. Let's say the fixed circle has radius R, and the rolling circle has radius r. \n\nAt any instant, the point of contact between the two circles is instantaneously at rest relative to the fixed circle. Therefore, the velocity of the point of contact on the rolling circle is zero. \n\nThe velocity of the center of the rolling circle is v = ω_center * (R + r), where ω_center is the angular velocity of the center around the fixed circle. \n\nThe angular velocity of the rolling circle about its own center is ω_rolling. \n\nThe velocity of the point of contact on the rolling circle is v_rolling = ω_rolling * r. \n\nBut since the point of contact is instantaneously at rest, v_rolling must be equal to the velocity of the center in the opposite direction. \n\nWait, the velocity of the point of contact is the velocity of the center minus the velocity due to rotation. \n\nIf the center is moving with velocity v = ω_center * (R + r) in the tangential direction, then the velocity of the point of contact is v - ω_rolling * r. \n\nSince the point of contact is at rest, v - ω_rolling * r = 0. \n\nTherefore, ω_center * (R + r) = ω_rolling * r. \n\nTherefore, ω_rolling = ω_center * (R + r)/r. \n\nNow, the angular velocity of the center around the fixed circle is ω_center = dθ/dt, where θ is the angle swept by the center. \n\nThe angular velocity of the rolling circle is ω_rolling = dφ/dt, where φ is the rotation angle of the rolling circle. \n\nTherefore, dφ/dt = (R + r)/r * dθ/dt. \n\nIntegrating over one full trip, where θ goes from 0 to 2π, we get φ = (R + r)/r * θ. \n\nWhen θ = 2π, φ = (R + r)/r * 2π. \n\nThe number of rotations is φ / (2π) = (R + r)/r = 1 + R/r. \n\nSo this gives the same result as before, which for R = r gives 2 rotations, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, this seems to be the correct approach. \n\nSo in our problem, R is 3r, so the number of rotations is 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 4. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought about the arc length on the fixed circle being Rθ and equating it to rφ, I got φ = (R/r)θ, which gave the wrong answer. But this new approach using velocities gives the correct result. \n\nSo why is there a discrepancy? \n\nBecause the arc length on the fixed circle is Rθ, but the arc length rolled over by the rolling circle is not equal to that. Instead, the rolling circle's rotation is determined by the velocity of the center and the no-slip condition. \n\nTherefore, the correct formula is (R + r)/r, which gives 4 in this case. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 4. \n\nBut to confirm, let's take the example where R = r. Then the number of rotations is 2, which matches the known result. If R = 2r, then it would be 1 + 2 = 3 rotations. \n\nYes, that seems to make sense. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many times Circle A revolves as it rolls around Circle B without slipping, we analyze the motion using geometric and kinematic principles.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Parameters and Setup**\n\n- Let the radius of **Circle B** be $ R $.\n- Then the radius of **Circle A** is $ r = \\frac{R}{3} $.\n- The two circles are **externally tangent**, and **Circle A rolls around Circle B** without slipping.\n- The **center of Circle A** traces a circular path of radius $ R + r = \\frac{4R}{3} $.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Rolling Motion**\n\nWhen a circle rolls without slipping, the **distance traveled by the center** of the rolling circle is equal to the **arc length** that the circle rolls over. This is a direct consequence of the **no-slip condition**.\n\n- The **distance traveled by the center of Circle A** in one full trip around Circle B is the **circumference of the path** it traces:\n  $$\n  \\text{Distance} = 2\\pi \\left( R + r \\right) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{4R}{3} \\right) = \\frac{8\\pi R}{3}\n  $$\n\n- The **circumference of Circle A** is:\n  $$\n  \\text{Circumference of A} = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{R}{3} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi R}{3}\n  $$\n\n- The **number of revolutions** that Circle A makes is the total distance traveled divided by its own circumference:\n  $$\n  \\text{Number of Revolutions} = \\frac{\\frac{8\\pi R}{3}}{\\frac{2\\pi R}{3}} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Derivation Using Angular Velocities**\n\nLet’s consider the angular motion of the center of Circle A and its rotation about its own center.\n\n- The **angular velocity** of the center of Circle A around Circle B is $ \\omega_{\\text{center}} $.\n- The **angular velocity** of Circle A about its own center is $ \\omega_{\\text{rolling}} $.\n- The **no-slip condition** implies that the tangential velocity at the point of contact is zero:\n  $$\n  v_{\\text{center}} = \\omega_{\\text{center}} (R + r) = \\omega_{\\text{rolling}} r\n  $$\n  $$\n  \\Rightarrow \\omega_{\\text{rolling}} = \\omega_{\\text{center}} \\cdot \\frac{R + r}{r}\n  $$\n\n- Over one full trip, the angle swept by the center is $ 2\\pi $, so the total rotation angle of Circle A is:\n  $$\n  \\phi = \\omega_{\\text{rolling}} \\cdot t = \\omega_{\\text{center}} \\cdot \\frac{R + r}{r} \\cdot t\n  $$\n  Since $ \\omega_{\\text{center}} \\cdot t = 2\\pi $, we get:\n  $$\n  \\phi = 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{R + r}{r}\n  $$\n\n- The number of revolutions is:\n  $$\n  \\frac{\\phi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{R + r}{r} = 1 + \\frac{R}{r}\n  $$\n\n- Substituting $ r = \\frac{R}{3} $, we get:\n  $$\n  \\frac{R + r}{r} = 1 + \\frac{R}{R/3} = 1 + 3 = 4\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth the geometric and kinematic approaches confirm that **Circle A revolves 4 times** as it rolls around Circle B without slipping.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$",

    "explanation": "Let the radius of Circle A be r and the radius of Circle B be 3r. When Circle A rolls around Circle B, it traces a circular path with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of both circles, which is r + 3r = 4r.\nThe distance Circle A travels along this path is equal to the circumference of the circular path, which is 2 * pi * 4r = 8 * pi * r.\nThe number of times Circle A revolves is equal to the distance it travels divided by its own circumference. The circumference of Circle A is 2 * pi * r.\nSo, the number of times Circle A revolves is (8 * pi * r) / (2 * pi * r) = 8 / 2 = 4 times.",
