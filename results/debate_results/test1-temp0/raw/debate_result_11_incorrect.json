    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, the question is about the chance that at least one match would be found when comparing a murderer's fingerprint with 20,000 innocent people, given that the chance of a false match (a mistake in the fingerprint comparison) is 0.01%. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The police have a murderer's fingerprint from the crime scene. They compare it with 20,000 people, and one of them matches. But all these 20,000 people are actually innocent. The expert says that the chance of a false match (i.e., two different people's fingerprints being mistakenly identified as the same) is 0.01%. So, the question is asking: what's the probability that at least one of these 20,000 innocent people would have a matching fingerprint with the murderer's, purely by chance?\n\nWait, but if all 20,000 are innocent, then the murderer isn't among them. So, the only way a match could occur is if the fingerprint comparison technology made a mistake. So, the problem is essentially asking: if you have 20,000 people, each with a 0.01% chance of a false match with the murderer's fingerprint, what's the probability that at least one of them has a false match?\n\nBut hold on, the 0.01% is the chance that the technology mistakes two fingerprints as the same. So, for each innocent person, the probability that their fingerprint is falsely matched to the murderer's is 0.01%, which is 0.0001. \n\nSo, the problem becomes similar to the classic probability question where you have multiple independent trials, and you want the probability of at least one success (in this case, a false match). The formula for that is 1 minus the probability of no successes in all trials.\n\nSo, if each person has a 0.0001 chance of a false match, then the probability that a single person does not have a false match is 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999. \n\nFor 20,000 people, the probability that none of them have a false match would be (0.9999)^20000. Then, the probability that at least one has a false match is 1 - (0.9999)^20000.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's the right approach. The problem states that the chance of a mistake is 0.01%, so that's per comparison. So, each comparison between the murderer's fingerprint and an innocent person's has a 0.0001 chance of being a false match. Since the comparisons are independent (assuming that the fingerprints are independent, which they probably are), then the probability of at least one false match in 20,000 comparisons is indeed 1 - (1 - 0.0001)^20000.\n\nCalculating that exponent: (1 - 0.0001)^20000. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, note that ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x^2/2 - ... for small x. So, ln(0.9999) ≈ -0.0001 - (0.0001)^2/2 ≈ -0.0001. Therefore, ln(0.9999^20000) ≈ 20000 * (-0.0001) = -2. So, exponentiating both sides, 0.9999^20000 ≈ e^{-2} ≈ 0.1353. Therefore, 1 - 0.1353 ≈ 0.8647, so about 86.47% chance of at least one false match.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. If each comparison has a 0.01% chance, then with 20,000 comparisons, the expected number of false matches is 20,000 * 0.0001 = 2. So, the expected number is 2. The probability of at least one is roughly 1 - e^{-2} ≈ 86.47%, which is what I calculated. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with exact calculation. Let's compute (1 - 0.0001)^20000. Let me use natural logarithm:\n\nln( (1 - 0.0001)^20000 ) = 20000 * ln(0.9999) ≈ 20000 * (-0.000100005) ≈ -2.0001. So, e^{-2.0001} ≈ e^{-2} ≈ 0.1353. Therefore, 1 - 0.1353 ≈ 0.8647, so 86.47%.\n\nBut maybe the exact value is slightly different. Let me check with a calculator. However, since I can't compute it exactly here, but the approximation using the Poisson distribution is that when n is large and p is small, the probability of at least one success is approximately 1 - e^{-λ}, where λ = n*p. Here, λ = 20000 * 0.0001 = 2. So, 1 - e^{-2} ≈ 86.47%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 86.47%, which is roughly 86.5%.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?\" So, given that all 20,000 are innocent, the chance that at least one of them is falsely matched is about 86.5%.\n\nBut the problem is presented in a court context. The expert says that the chance of a mistake is 0.01%, but the police found a match. However, the question is not about the probability that the suspect is innocent given the match, but rather the probability that at least one match would be found in 20,000 innocent people. So, the answer is about 86.5%.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%.\" So, that is the probability that a single comparison between two different fingerprints is a false match. So, for each innocent person, the probability that their fingerprint is falsely matched to the murderer's is 0.01%, which is 0.0001. Therefore, with 20,000 people, the expected number of false matches is 2, and the probability of at least one is about 86.5%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%, which is roughly 86.5%. But maybe the exact value is slightly different. Let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula 1 - (1 - p)^n, where p = 0.0001, n = 20000.\n\nSo, (1 - p)^n = e^{n * ln(1 - p)} ≈ e^{-n*p - n*p^2/2 - ...} ≈ e^{-2 - 20000*(0.0001)^2 / 2} = e^{-2 - 20000*(0.00000001)/2} = e^{-2 - 0.0001} ≈ e^{-2.0001} ≈ e^{-2} * e^{-0.0001} ≈ 0.1353 * 0.9999 ≈ 0.1353. So, the correction is negligible. Therefore, the approximation is very close.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?\" So, given that all 20,000 are innocent, the probability that at least one of them is falsely matched is about 86.5%.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%.\" So, that is the probability that a single comparison between two different fingerprints is a false match. Therefore, each comparison has a 0.01% chance of being a false match. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%, which is 86.47% when calculated more precisely. So, rounding to two decimal places, 86.47%, or approximately 86.5%.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again. Is there a possibility that the 0.01% is the probability that a random person's fingerprint matches the murderer's, assuming they are innocent? If that's the case, then the calculation is the same. But the problem states that the chance of the technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%. So, that is the probability that two different fingerprints are considered a match by the technology. Therefore, for each innocent person, the probability that their fingerprint is falsely matched to the murderer's is 0.01%, so the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we model this as a binomial distribution with n=20000 trials, p=0.0001. The probability of at least one success is 1 - P(0 successes). P(0 successes) is (1 - p)^n, which is the same as before. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, using the Poisson approximation, which is good for rare events. The Poisson distribution with λ = n*p = 2. The probability of zero events is e^{-λ} = e^{-2} ≈ 0.1353, so the probability of at least one is 1 - 0.1353 ≈ 0.8647, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting a different answer. Wait, but the question is not about the probability that the suspect is innocent, but rather the probability that at least one match would be found in 20,000 innocent people. So, given that the police found a match, but all are innocent, the chance that such a match would occur is about 86.5%. Therefore, the answer is approximately 86.5%.\n\nBut maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that the probability is 0.01%, but that's the per-comparison error rate. However, when you do multiple comparisons, the chance of at least one error increases. So, the answer is indeed around 86.5%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is approximately 86.5%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that at least one false match occurs when comparing the murderer's fingerprint with 20,000 innocent individuals, given a 0.01% error rate per comparison, is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Per-Comparison Error Rate**: Each comparison has a 0.01% (or 0.0001) chance of falsely matching two fingerprints.\n2. **Probability of No Matches**: The probability that a single person does **not** produce a false match is $1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999$. For 20,000 independent comparisons, this becomes $0.9999^{20000}$.\n3. **Approximation Using Exponential Function**: For small $p$, $ (1 - p)^n \\approx e^{-np} $. Here, $np = 20000 \\times 0.0001 = 2$, so $0.9999^{20000} \\approx e^{-2} \\approx 0.1353$.\n4. **Probability of At Least One Match**: Subtract the above from 1:  \n   $$\n   1 - e^{-2} \\approx 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647 \\quad \\text{(or 86.47%)}.\n   $$\n\n**Answer**: Approximately **86.5%**. This means there is an 86.5% chance that at least one false match would occur among the 20,000 innocent individuals due to the 0.01% error rate per comparison.",
