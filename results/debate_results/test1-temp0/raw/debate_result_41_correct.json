    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the expected ratio of boys to girls in a country where every family keeps having children until they have a boy. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that in most countries, the natural sex ratio at birth is roughly 105 boys to 100 girls, but maybe the question assumes a 50-50 chance for simplicity. The problem says all families want a boy and stop once they have one. So each family will have at least one child, which is a boy. But some families might have multiple children if they have girls first.\n\nLet me think about the probability. If each birth is independent and has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl, then for each family, the number of children they have depends on how many girls they have before a boy. So the first child has a 50% chance of being a boy, which would mean the family stops. If it's a girl (50%), they have another child. Then again, 50% chance for a boy, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a geometric distribution problem. The expected number of children per family would be the sum over all possible numbers of children multiplied by their probabilities. For a geometric distribution with success probability p (here p=0.5 for a boy), the expected number of trials until the first success is 1/p. So that would be 2 children per family on average. But since each family stops at the first boy, the expected number of girls per family would be the expected number of trials minus 1 (since the last child is a boy). So that would be 1 girl per family on average?\n\nWait, but if the expected number of children is 2, and each family has exactly one boy, then the expected number of girls would be 1. So the ratio would be 1 boy to 1 girl, making the overall ratio 1:1? But that seems counterintuitive because families are stopping when they get a boy, so maybe there are more boys?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If each family has one boy, and the number of girls per family is a geometric distribution minus one. The expected number of girls per family is (1-p)/p. Since p=0.5, that would be (1-0.5)/0.5 = 1. So each family has 1 girl on average. Therefore, the total number of boys and girls would be equal? So the ratio is 1:1?\n\nBut I remember hearing that the ratio remains 1:1 even with this stopping strategy. But why is that? Because even though families stop after a boy, the probability of each birth is still 50-50. So the overall proportion remains the same. But maybe I need to verify this with a more concrete example.\n\nLet's consider a large number of families. Suppose there are N families. Each family will have one boy, so total boys are N. Now, how many girls are there? For each family, the number of girls is the number of failures before the first success in a geometric distribution. The expected number of girls per family is (1-p)/p = 1. So total girls would be N*1 = N. Therefore, total boys and girls are both N, so the ratio is 1:1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model it recursively. Let E be the expected number of girls per family. The first child has a 50% chance of being a boy, in which case there are 0 girls. If it's a girl (50%), then we have 1 girl plus the expected number of girls from the subsequent children. So E = 0.5*0 + 0.5*(1 + E). Solving this equation: E = 0.5*(1 + E) => E = 0.5 + 0.5E => 0.5E = 0.5 => E = 1. So again, the expected number of girls per family is 1, same as the number of boys (1 per family). Therefore, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nBut wait, some people might think that since families stop after a boy, there would be more boys. But the math shows that the expectation balances out. Another way to see it is that each birth is an independent event with 50% chance. So even though families stop after a boy, the overall proportion of boys and girls in the population remains 50-50. The stopping rule doesn't affect the probability of each individual birth.\n\nBut maybe there's a different approach. Suppose we consider all the births. Each family has a sequence of children until a boy is born. The total number of boys is equal to the number of families, since each family has exactly one boy. The total number of girls is the sum over all families of the number of girls each family has. Since each family's number of girls is a geometric distribution with p=0.5, the expected number of girls per family is 1, so total girls is N*1 = N. Therefore, boys and girls are equal in expectation.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about the probability of each child being a girl or a boy. For each child born, regardless of the family's strategy, the probability is 50-50. So even though families stop after a boy, the overall proportion of boys and girls in the entire population should still be 50-50. Because each birth is an independent event with equal probability.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different way to model it. Suppose we have a large number of families. Let's say 1000 families. Each family will have one boy. Now, how many girls? The first round: 500 families have a boy, 500 have a girl. The 500 that had a girl will try again. In the second round, 250 of those will have a boy, 250 will have a girl. The 250 that had a girl will try again. Third round: 125 boys, 125 girls. And so on. The total number of girls is 500 + 250 + 125 + ... which is a geometric series. The sum of this series is 500 / (1 - 0.5) ) = 1000. Wait, but that would mean total girls is 1000, same as the number of boys (1000). So the ratio is 1:1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The total number of girls is the sum of 500 + 250 + 125 + ... which is 1000. So the total number of children is 1000 boys + 1000 girls = 2000 children. Therefore, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nSo even though families are stopping after a boy, the expected number of girls ends up being equal to the number of boys. Therefore, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nBut I should check if there's any assumption here. The key assumption is that the probability of a boy or girl is 50-50, and that each birth is independent. If the natural sex ratio is different, say 105 boys to 100 girls, then the ratio would be different. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think we can assume 50-50.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the expected number of girls per family is 1, and the expected number of boys is 1. So the ratio is 1:1. Therefore, the answer is 1:1.\n</think>\n\nThe expected ratio of boys to girls in the country remains **1:1**. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Assumptions**: Each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl, independent of previous births. Families stop having children after their first boy.\n\n2. **Expected Number of Children per Family**:  \n   - The number of children per family follows a geometric distribution with success probability $ p = 0.5 $ (for a boy).  \n   - The expected number of children per family is $ \\frac{1}{p} = 2 $ (1 boy + 1 girl on average).\n\n3. **Expected Number of Girls per Family**:  \n   - Since each family stops after the first boy, the expected number of girls per family is $ \\frac{1 - p}{p} = 1 $ (from the geometric distribution formula).  \n   - Thus, each family contributes **1 girl** and **1 boy** on average.\n\n4. **Population-Wide Ratio**:  \n   - If there are $ N $ families, the total number of boys is $ N $ (one per family).  \n   - The total number of girls is also $ N $ (since each family contributes 1 girl on average).  \n   - Therefore, the ratio of boys to girls is $ N:N = 1:1 $.\n\n5. **Alternative Perspective**:  \n   - Consider all births as independent events. The stopping rule (stopping after a boy) does not alter the probability of each individual birth being a boy or girl.  \n   - Over time, the proportion of boys and girls in the population remains balanced at 50-50.\n\n**Conclusion**: The expected ratio of boys to girls is **1:1**, regardless of the stopping rule. The key insight is that the probability of each birth remains independent and equal, ensuring the overall population ratio remains balanced.",
