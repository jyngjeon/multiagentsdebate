    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Alice and Bob playing a game with two unfair dice. The dice have different probabilities: rolling a 6 is 1/4, and any other number (1-5) is 1/8 each. Alice wins if both dice show the same number, and Bob wins if they are different. We need to find the probability that Bob wins.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that when dealing with probabilities of events, especially with multiple outcomes, it's often helpful to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract from 1. In this case, since Alice wins when the numbers are the same, Bob's probability of winning is 1 minus the probability that Alice wins. That might be a good approach.\n\nSo, let me start by calculating the probability that both dice show the same number. For that, I need to consider all possible numbers (1 through 6) and find the probability that both dice show that number, then sum those probabilities.\n\nLet me break it down. For each number from 1 to 5, the probability of rolling that number on one die is 1/8. For the number 6, it's 1/4. Since the dice are independent, the probability that both dice show the same number is the sum over each number of (probability of that number on die 1) multiplied by (probability of that number on die 2).\n\nSo, for numbers 1 to 5: each has a probability of 1/8 on each die. So for each of these numbers, the probability that both dice show that number is (1/8)*(1/8) = 1/64. Since there are 5 such numbers, that's 5*(1/64) = 5/64.\n\nThen for the number 6: the probability on each die is 1/4, so the probability that both show 6 is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nAdding those together: 5/64 + 1/16. To add these, convert 1/16 to 4/64, so total is 5/64 + 4/64 = 9/64. Therefore, the probability that Alice wins is 9/64. Therefore, Bob's probability of winning is 1 - 9/64 = 55/64.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, confirm the probabilities for each number. The problem states that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and any other number is 1/8. Since there are 5 other numbers (1-5), each with 1/8, that adds up to 5*(1/8) = 5/8. Then adding the probability of 6, which is 1/4 = 2/8, total probability is 5/8 + 2/8 = 7/8. Wait, that's only 7/8. But the total probability for all outcomes should be 1. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on. If each die has probabilities: P(6) = 1/4, and P(1) through P(5) each is 1/8. Let's check if the total probability sums to 1. For one die: 1/4 (for 6) plus 5*(1/8) for the other numbers. 5/8 is 0.625, and 1/4 is 0.25. Adding them gives 0.875, which is 7/8. That's not 1. That can't be right. There's a mistake here. The problem must have a typo, or I misread it.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, while the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8.\" Wait, but if there are 6 sides, and one of them (6) has probability 1/4, and the other five have 1/8 each, then total probability is 1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 1/4 + 5/8 = 2/8 + 5/8 = 7/8. That's less than 1. That's impossible. So there must be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each. But that would not sum to 1. Alternatively, maybe the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but that would require that the total is 1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 7/8. So that's not possible. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 3/8? Wait, but that's not what's written.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the dice are not fair, but the probabilities are adjusted so that each number has a certain probability. Wait, but the way it's written, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and any other number is 1/8. That can't be. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling a number that is not 6 is 1/8? But that would be even worse. Because then the total probability would be 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8, which is even less.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 3/8? But that would be inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers? No, dice have six sides.\n\nWait, this seems like a critical error. If the problem states that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8, then the total probability is 1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 1/4 + 5/8 = 7/8. Which is not 1. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement. But since the user provided this problem, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each. But that would require that the total probability is 1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 7/8. Therefore, the problem is ill-posed. However, perhaps the user made a typo, and the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 3/8? Wait, but that would be 1/4 + 5*(3/8) = 1/4 + 15/8 = 1/4 + 1.875 = 2.125, which is more than 1. That's not possible either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers? But that's not a standard die. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling a number that is not 6 is 3/4, and that 3/4 is distributed equally among the other five numbers. So each of the other numbers would have probability (3/4)/5 = 3/20. Which is 0.15, which is 3/20. But the problem says 1/8, which is 0.125. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the dice are not fair, but the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8. But that would mean that the total probability is 7/8, which is not 1. Therefore, the problem is invalid. However, since the user is asking this question, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers. Wait, but that's not a standard die. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the die is a 5-sided die? But the question mentions two dice, which are standard, but with different probabilities. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only four other numbers. Wait, but that would be a 5-sided die. But the problem says \"two dice\", which are standard, so six sides. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the user made a mistake in the problem statement. But since I have to work with what's given, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the probabilities are as stated, even though they don't sum to 1. But that would be impossible. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers. Wait, but that's not a standard die. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8, but there are two other numbers? That would be a three-sided die. But the problem says two dice, which are standard. This is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, and the total probability is 7/8, but there's an eighth chance of something else? But that's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers. Wait, but that would be a five-sided die. But the problem says two dice, which are standard. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers. Wait, but that would be 1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 7/8. So there's a missing 1/8. Maybe the problem intended that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are seven numbers? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only four numbers. Wait, but that's not a standard die. This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the problem has a typo, and the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 3/8. Let's check that: 1/4 + 5*(3/8) = 1/4 + 15/8 = 2/8 + 15/8 = 17/8, which is more than 1. No good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only four other numbers. So, for example, a five-sided die with numbers 1-5 and 6. Wait, but that's not standard. If it's a five-sided die, then numbers 1-5, and 6 is not on the die. But the problem says two dice, which are standard. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the total probability is 7/8, and there's an eighth chance of some other outcome, but the problem doesn't mention it. However, since the problem is about rolling numbers 1-6, that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers. So, for example, the die has numbers 1-5 and 6, but the probability of 6 is 1/4, and each of 1-5 is 1/8. Then total probability is 1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 7/8. But then there's a missing 1/8. Maybe the die is biased in such a way that there's a 1/8 chance of rolling nothing? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only four other numbers. So, for example, numbers 1-4 and 6. Then total probability would be 1/4 + 4*(1/8) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. Still not 1.\n\nThis is a problem. The given probabilities don't sum to 1, which is a fundamental requirement for probability distributions. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user is asking this question, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the probabilities are as stated, even though they don't sum to 1, or maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers. Wait, but that would be a five-sided die. If the die is five-sided, then numbers 1-5, and 6 is not on the die. But the problem says two dice, which are standard. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers. Then, the total probability is 7/8, which is missing 1/8. Maybe the problem is that the die is not a standard die, but has an eighth chance of some other outcome, but the problem doesn't mention it. However, since the problem is about Alice and Bob's game, which depends on the numbers rolled, perhaps we can assume that the probabilities are normalized. That is, even though the given probabilities sum to 7/8, we can assume that the remaining 1/8 is distributed somehow, but the problem doesn't specify. This is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 3/8. Let's check that: 1/4 + 5*(3/8) = 1/4 + 15/8 = 2/8 + 15/8 = 17/8, which is more than 1. No good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only four other numbers. So, for example, numbers 1-4 and 6. Then total probability is 1/4 + 4*(1/8) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. Still not 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only three other numbers. Then total probability is 1/4 + 3*(1/8) = 1/4 + 3/8 = 5/8. Still not 1.\n\nThis is really confusing. Since the problem is presented as is, perhaps I should proceed with the given probabilities, even though they don't sum to 1, and see if that leads to a solution. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers, and the sixth number is not considered. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers, and the total probability is 7/8, and the remaining 1/8 is distributed as zero probability for some number. But that would mean that some numbers have zero probability, which is possible, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers, and the sixth number is 6. Wait, that would be a five-sided die with numbers 1-5 and 6. But that's not standard.\n\nThis is a critical issue. Without knowing the correct probabilities, I can't compute the answer. However, since the user is asking this question, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, while the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8.\" So, for each die, P(6) = 1/4, and for each number from 1 to 5, P(number) = 1/8. So, for one die, the total probability is 1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 1/4 + 5/8 = 7/8. Therefore, there's a missing 1/8. Maybe the problem assumes that the die is rolled until a number is obtained, and there's a 1/8 chance of rerolling? But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers. So, for example, the die has numbers 1-5 and 6, but the probability of 6 is 1/4, and each of 1-5 is 1/8. Then, the total probability is 7/8, and the remaining 1/8 is ignored. But that's not a valid probability distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers, and the probabilities are adjusted so that they sum to 1. For example, if the probability of 6 is 1/4, and the other five numbers have probabilities of (1 - 1/4)/5 = 3/20 each. But the problem says 1/8, which is 0.125, and 3/20 is 0.15. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 3/20 each. Then, total probability would be 1/4 + 5*(3/20) = 1/4 + 15/20 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. That works. But the problem says 1/8, which is 0.125, and 3/20 is 0.15. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only four other numbers. Then, total probability is 1/4 + 4*(1/8) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. Still not 1.\n\nThis is really a problem. Without knowing the correct probabilities, I can't proceed. However, since the user is asking this question, perhaps I should assume that the probabilities are as stated, even though they don't sum to 1, and proceed with the calculation, noting the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers, and the total probability is 7/8, and the remaining 1/8 is distributed as an eighth chance of rolling a 6 again? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers, and the probabilities are not normalized. In that case, the probabilities are given as P(6) = 1/4, P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = 1/8, and P(6) = 1/4, but the total is 7/8. So, to make it a valid probability distribution, we can normalize the probabilities by dividing each by 7/8. That is, the actual probabilities would be P(6) = (1/4) / (7/8) = 2/7, and P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = (1/8) / (7/8) = 1/7 each. Then, the total probability would be 2/7 + 5*(1/7) = 7/7 = 1. This might be the intended interpretation.\n\nBut the problem didn't mention normalization, so this is an assumption. However, given that the original probabilities don't sum to 1, this might be the only way to make sense of the problem. So, if we assume that the probabilities are given as P(6) = 1/4 and P(1-5) = 1/8 each, but they are normalized to sum to 1, then the actual probabilities would be as I calculated: P(6) = 2/7 and P(1-5) = 1/7 each.\n\nIf that's the case, then the probability that both dice show the same number would be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each number from 1 to 5: P(number on die 1) * P(number on die 2) = (1/7)*(1/7) = 1/49. There are 5 such numbers, so 5/49.\n\nFor number 6: (2/7)*(2/7) = 4/49.\n\nTotal probability that Alice wins: 5/49 + 4/49 = 9/49.\n\nTherefore, Bob's probability of winning is 1 - 9/49 = 40/49.\n\nBut this is based on the assumption that the original probabilities were normalized. However, the problem didn't state that, so this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, if we proceed with the original probabilities, even though they don't sum to 1, then the probability that both dice show the same number would be:\n\nFor numbers 1-5: 5*(1/8 * 1/8) = 5/64.\n\nFor number 6: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 = 4/64.\n\nTotal: 5/64 + 4/64 = 9/64.\n\nThen, Bob's probability is 1 - 9/64 = 55/64. But this assumes that the probabilities are as given, even though they don't sum to 1, which is invalid.\n\nGiven that the problem is presented as is, and assuming that it's a standard die with probabilities that sum to 1, the most plausible correction is that the probabilities are normalized. Therefore, the answer would be 40/49. However, without explicit normalization, it's hard to say.\n\nBut since the user is likely expecting the answer based on the given probabilities, even though they are inconsistent, perhaps the intended answer is 55/64, assuming that the probabilities are as stated, and the missing 1/8 is ignored or considered as a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only five numbers. So, for example, a five-sided die with numbers 1-5 and 6, but that's not standard. If we proceed with that, then the total probability is 7/8, and the calculation would be as before: 9/64 for Alice, 55/64 for Bob.\n\nBut this is all very speculative. Given that, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 3/8 each. Wait, but that would be 1/4 + 5*(3/8) = 1/4 + 15/8 = 17/8, which is more than 1. No good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are only four other numbers. Then, total probability is 1/4 + 4*(1/8) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. Still not 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers, and the probabilities are as given, and the total is 7/8, and the remaining 1/8 is distributed as a 0 probability for some number. For example, if the die has numbers 1-5 and 6, but the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and each of 1-5 is 1/8, and there's a 1/8 chance of rolling nothing, but that's not part of the game. However, since the game is about rolling numbers, maybe we can ignore that 1/8.\n\nIn that case, the probability that both dice show the same number would be calculated as before: 9/64, and Bob's probability is 55/64. But this is assuming that the 1/8 is ignored, which is not rigorous.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the problem might have a typo, but the most common way to adjust the probabilities to sum to 1 is by normalizing, leading to 40/49, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8 each, but there are six numbers, and the probabilities are as given, and the total is 7/8, and the remaining 1/8 is distributed as an eighth chance of rolling a 6 again. But that would mean P(6) = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8, and the other numbers are 1/8 each. Then total probability would be 3/8 + 5*(1/8) = 8/8 = 1. That could be a possible correction.\n\nIf that's the case, then P(6) = 3/8, and P(1-5) = 1/8 each. Then, the probability that both dice show the same number would be:\n\nFor numbers 1-5: 5*(1/8 * 1/8) = 5/64.\n\nFor number 6: 3/8 * 3/8 = 9/64.\n\nTotal: 5/64 + 9/64 = 14/64 = 7/32.\n\nThen, Bob's probability is 1 - 7/32 = 25/32.\n\nBut this is another assumption, changing the probability of 6 to 3/8.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the ambiguity, but assuming that the problem intended that the probabilities sum to 1, and that the probability of 6 is 1/4, and the other numbers are equally likely, then the correct probabilities would be P(6) = 1/4, and P(1-5) = (1 - 1/4)/5 = 3/20 each. Then, the probability that both dice show the same number would be:\n\nFor numbers 1-5: 5*(3/20 * 3/20) = 5*(9/400) = 45/400 = 9/80.\n\nFor number 6: (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16 = 25/400.\n\nTotal: 9/80 + 1/16 = 9/80 + 5/80 = 14/80 = 7/40.\n\nThen, Bob's probability is 1 - 7/40 = 33/40.\n\nBut this is another assumption.\n\nGiven all these possibilities, it's clear that the problem as stated has an inconsistency. However, since the user is asking for the probability, and given that the original calculation (assuming the given probabilities, even though they don't sum to 1) gives 55/64, which is a clean answer, perhaps that's what is expected, despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4, and the other numbers are 1/8 each, but there are six numbers, and the total probability is 7/8, and the remaining 1/8 is distributed as an eighth chance of rolling a 6, making P(6) = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8, then the calculation would be as before, leading to 25/32.\n\nBut without knowing the exact correction, it's impossible to be certain. However, given that the original problem states the probabilities as 1/4 for 6 and 1/8 for others, and assuming that the user might have made a typo, but the most common way to adjust is to normalize, leading to 40/49, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if we proceed with the given probabilities, ignoring the inconsistency, then the answer is 55/64.\n\nSince the user might expect the answer based on the given probabilities, even with the inconsistency, I'll proceed with that calculation, noting the issue.\n</think>\n\nThe problem presents a scenario with two unfair dice where the probability of rolling a 6 is $ \\frac{1}{4} $, and the probability of rolling any other number (1–5) is $ \\frac{1}{8} $. However, this setup is **invalid** because the total probability for a single die does not sum to 1:\n\n$$\nP(6) + \\sum_{i=1}^5 P(i) = \\frac{1}{4} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{7}{8} \\neq 1.\n$$\n\nThis inconsistency implies the problem is ill-posed. To resolve this, we **normalize** the probabilities to ensure they sum to 1. The corrected probabilities are:\n\n- $ P(6) = \\frac{1/4}{7/8} = \\frac{2}{7} $,\n- $ P(i) = \\frac{1/8}{7/8} = \\frac{1}{7} $ for $ i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 $.\n\nNow, compute the probability that **Alice wins** (both dice show the same number):\n\n- For numbers 1–5: $ 5 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\right) = \\frac{5}{49} $,\n- For number 6: $ \\frac{2}{7} \\cdot \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{4}{49} $.\n\nTotal probability Alice wins:  \n$$\n\\frac{5}{49} + \\frac{4}{49} = \\frac{9}{49}.\n$$\n\nThus, the probability that **Bob wins** (numbers are different) is:  \n$$\n1 - \\frac{9}{49} = \\frac{40}{49}.\n$$\n\n**Answer:** $ \\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{49}} $",

        "84.38%",
        "0.8438",
        "27/32"
    ],
    "explanation": "The probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4. The probability of rolling other 6 numbers is each 1/8. To calculate the probability of Bob winning, we need to first consider the outcomes where the numbers on the two dice are the same (Alice wins). The probability of rolling a 6 on one die is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8. So, the probability of Alice winning is (1/4 * 1/4) + 6 * (1/8 * 1/8) = 5/32. Therefore, the probability that Bob will win the game is 1 - 5/32 = 27/32 (84.38%).",
    "incorrect answer": [
        "85.94%",
        "0.8594",
        "55/64"
    ],
    "incorrect explanation": "The probability of rolling a 6 is 1/4. The probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 is each 1/8. So, the probability of Alice winning is (1/4 * 1/4) + 5 * (1/8 * 1/8) = 9/64. Therefore, the probability that Bob will win the game is 1 - 9/64 = 55/64 (85.94%).",
    "Whether there is a preference": "Yes",
    "Supported Side": "Negative",
    "Reason": "The given probabilities for the die do not sum to 1 (1/4 + 5*(1/8) = 7/8), which is invalid. Normalizing the probabilities to sum to 1 (scaling by 8/7) yields valid probabilities: 2/7 for 6 and 1/7 for others. Recalculating with normalized values gives Bob's probability as 40/49, not 55/64. The affirmative side ignored the inconsistency, leading to an incorrect answer.",
