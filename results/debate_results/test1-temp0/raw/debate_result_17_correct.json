    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is: In a town, 60% of the women are married to 80% of the men. What percentage of the total adult population is married?\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The key is that 60% of the women are married, and these women are married to 80% of the men. So, the marriages are between these two groups. But how do I relate the percentages to the total population?\n\nLet me start by assuming there are a certain number of women and men in the town. Maybe I can assign variables to make it easier. Let's say the number of women is W and the number of men is M. Then the total adult population is W + M.\n\nNow, 60% of the women are married. That would be 0.6W women who are married. These women are married to 80% of the men, which is 0.8M men. But each marriage involves one man and one woman, right? So the number of married women should equal the number of married men, because each marriage is between one man and one woman. Wait, but here we have 0.6W women married to 0.8M men. So, does that mean that 0.6W = 0.8M? Because each married woman is married to a man, and each married man is married to a woman. Therefore, the number of married women must equal the number of married men. So, 0.6W = 0.8M. That seems important.\n\nSo, from this equation, I can solve for the ratio of women to men. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\n0.6W = 0.8M  \nDivide both sides by 0.2:  \n3W = 4M  \nSo, W/M = 4/3  \nWhich means that the number of women is 4/3 times the number of men. So, if there are 3 men, there are 4 women. Let me check that. If W = 4 and M = 3, then 0.6*4 = 2.4 women married, and 0.8*3 = 2.4 men married. That works. So the ratio of women to men is 4:3.\n\nNow, the total adult population is W + M. Let's use the ratio to express W and M in terms of a common variable. Let me let the number of men be 3x, so the number of women is 4x. Then total population is 3x + 4x = 7x.\n\nNow, the number of married people is the number of married women plus the number of married men. But wait, since each marriage is between one man and one woman, the total number of married people is 2*(number of marriages). But since we already have that the number of married women is 0.6W and the number of married men is 0.8M, and we know that 0.6W = 0.8M, which is 2.4x in the case where W=4x and M=3x. So, the number of married people is 2.4x (women) + 2.4x (men) = 4.8x.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total adult population that is married is (4.8x / 7x) * 100% = (4.8/7)*100%. Let me calculate that. 4.8 divided by 7. Let me do the division: 4.8 ÷ 7. Well, 7 goes into 4.8 0.6857 times approximately. Multiply by 100 gives about 68.57%. So approximately 68.57%.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Let me use actual numbers. Suppose there are 4 women and 3 men. Then 60% of women is 2.4 women married. 80% of men is 2.4 men married. So, 2.4 women married to 2.4 men. So total married people are 2.4 + 2.4 = 4.8. Total population is 7. So 4.8/7 is indeed 68.57%.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"percentage of the total adult population is married.\" So, that would be 68.57%, which is 48/70, which simplifies to 24/35. Let me check 24 divided by 35. 24 ÷ 35 is approximately 0.6857, so yes, 68.57%.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me try using variables again. Let me suppose that the number of women is W and men is M. Then, the number of married women is 0.6W, and the number of married men is 0.8M. Since each marriage is between one man and one woman, the number of married women must equal the number of married men. Therefore, 0.6W = 0.8M. So, W = (0.8/0.6)M = (4/3)M. Therefore, the ratio of women to men is 4:3. So, if there are 4 women for every 3 men, then total population is 7 parts. The number of married people is 0.6*4 = 2.4 women and 0.8*3 = 2.4 men, so total 4.8. 4.8/7 is 68.57%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions. Let me see. Let me take the ratio of women to men as 4:3. So, if there are 4 women and 3 men, then total population is 7. Married women: 60% of 4 is 2.4. Married men: 80% of 3 is 2.4. So, total married is 4.8. 4.8/7 is 68.57%.\n\nBut maybe the answer is 48%? Wait, no, because 4.8 is 48/10, but over 7. Wait, 4.8 divided by 7 is 0.6857, which is 68.57%. So that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's a different interpretation. The problem says \"60% of the women are married to 80% of the men.\" Does that mean that the 60% of women are married to the 80% of men, implying that each of those women is married to one of those men? So, the number of marriages is equal to the number of married women, which is 0.6W, and also equal to the number of married men, which is 0.8M. Therefore, 0.6W = 0.8M, which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a case where the same man is married to multiple women? But in reality, each person can only be married to one person, so the number of married women must equal the number of married men. Therefore, the initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 48/70, which is 68.57%, which is approximately 68.57%. To express this as a percentage, it's 68.57%, which can be written as 68.57% or as a fraction, 24/35, which is approximately 68.57%.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again. Suppose the total number of women is W and men is M. The number of married women is 0.6W, and the number of married men is 0.8M. Since each marriage involves one woman and one man, the number of married women must equal the number of married men. Therefore, 0.6W = 0.8M. Therefore, W = (0.8/0.6)M = (4/3)M. Therefore, the ratio of women to men is 4:3. So, if we take the total population as 4x + 3x = 7x. The number of married people is 0.6*4x + 0.8*3x = 2.4x + 2.4x = 4.8x. Therefore, the percentage is (4.8x / 7x) * 100% = 4.8/7 * 100% ≈ 68.57%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer is approximately 68.57%, which is 68.57%. Depending on how the question wants the answer, maybe as a fraction or a decimal. But since the question says \"percentage,\" probably 68.57%, or maybe they want it as a fraction like 48/70, but simplified. 48/70 reduces to 24/35, which is approximately 68.57%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach it. Let me try using actual numbers. Let's say there are 100 women. Then 60% of them are married, so 60 women are married. These 60 women are married to 80% of the men. Let me find out how many men there are. Let the number of men be M. Then 80% of M is 0.8M. Since each of the 60 women is married to one man, the number of married men is 60. Therefore, 0.8M = 60. Solving for M: M = 60 / 0.8 = 75. So there are 75 men. Therefore, total population is 100 women + 75 men = 175. The number of married people is 60 women + 60 men = 120. Therefore, the percentage is (120 / 175) * 100% = (120/175)*100. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 175. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 5: 24/35. Which is the same as before, 24/35 ≈ 0.6857, so 68.57%.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So regardless of the approach, the answer is 68.57%. Therefore, the percentage of the total adult population that is married is approximately 68.57%, which can be written as 68.57% or as a fraction 24/35.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an exact fraction. 24/35 is the exact value. Let me check 24 divided by 35. 35*0.7 = 24.5, so 0.7 is 24.5/35, so 24/35 is 0.6857... So yes, 68.57%.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects rounding, maybe to the nearest whole number, but the question doesn't specify. However, since the original percentages are given as whole numbers (60% and 80%), but the answer comes out to a repeating decimal, so it's better to present it as a fraction or the exact decimal.\n\nBut in the problem statement, they might expect the answer as 48/70, but simplified. However, 48/70 reduces to 24/35. So, 24/35 is the simplified fraction, which is approximately 68.57%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 68.57%, or 24/35.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the percentage of the total adult population that is married, we analyze the relationship between the number of married women and married men, given that **60% of the women are married to 80% of the men**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Define Variables\nLet:\n- $ W $ = number of women\n- $ M $ = number of men\n\nFrom the problem:\n- 60% of the women are married: $ 0.6W $\n- 80% of the men are married: $ 0.8M $\n\nSince each marriage involves one woman and one man, the number of married women must equal the number of married men:\n$$\n0.6W = 0.8M\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solve for the Ratio of Women to Men\n$$\n\\frac{W}{M} = \\frac{0.8}{0.6} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\n\nThis means for every 4 women, there are 3 men.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Express Total Population\nLet the number of men be $ 3x $, then the number of women is $ 4x $.  \nTotal adult population:\n$$\nW + M = 4x + 3x = 7x\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Number of Married People\n- Married women: $ 0.6 \\times 4x = 2.4x $\n- Married men: $ 0.8 \\times 3x = 2.4x $\n\nTotal married people:\n$$\n2.4x + 2.4x = 4.8x\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Percentage\n$$\n\\text{Percentage married} = \\left( \\frac{4.8x}{7x} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{4.8}{7} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 68.57\\%\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{68.57\\%}\n$$\n\nThis is the percentage of the total adult population that is married.",

    "answer": [
        "68.57%",

    ],
    "explanation": "Let's assume there are W women and M men in the town. According to the given information, 0.6W women are married to 0.8M men. Since each married woman is married to one married man, we have 0.6W = 0.8M. Now, let's express M in terms of W: M = (0.6W) / 0.8 = 0.75W. The total adult population is W + M = W + 0.75W = 1.75W. The total number of married people is 0.6W + 0.8M = 0.6W + 0.8(0.75W) = 1.2W. So, the percentage of the total adult population that is married is (1.2W / 1.75W) * 100 = 68.57%.",
