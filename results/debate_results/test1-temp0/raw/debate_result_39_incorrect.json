    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about distributing 50 white and 50 black balls into two bowls to maximize the probability of picking a white ball when selecting a random bowl and then a random ball from that bowl. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the selection is done in two steps: first choosing a bowl at random, then picking a ball from that bowl. So the overall probability would be the average of the probabilities of picking a white ball from each bowl, right? Because each bowl has a 50% chance of being selected.\n\nWait, but maybe not exactly. Let me think. If there are two bowls, the probability of choosing either bowl is 1/2. Then, for each bowl, the probability of picking a white ball is (number of white balls in that bowl) divided by (total balls in that bowl). So the total probability is (1/2)*P(white from bowl 1) + (1/2)*P(white from bowl 2). So I need to maximize this sum.\n\nSo the challenge is to distribute the balls between the two bowls in such a way that this sum is as large as possible. But how?\n\nI remember something about this problem from probability puzzles. Maybe the optimal strategy is to put one white ball in one bowl and the rest in the other? Let me check that.\n\nSuppose I put 1 white ball in Bowl 1 and the remaining 49 white and 50 black balls in Bowl 2. Then, the probability would be:\n\nFor Bowl 1: 1/1 = 1 (since there's only one white ball, so 100% chance of picking white if you choose this bowl).\n\nFor Bowl 2: (49 white)/(49 + 50) = 49/99 ≈ 0.4949.\n\nSo total probability is (1/2)*1 + (1/2)*(49/99) ≈ 0.5 + 0.2474 ≈ 0.7474, which is about 74.74%.\n\nAlternatively, if I split the balls evenly, say 25 white and 25 black in each bowl. Then each bowl has 50 balls. The probability for each bowl is 25/50 = 0.5. So total probability is 0.5*0.5 + 0.5*0.5 = 0.5. That's worse than 74.74%.\n\nAnother idea: what if I put all white balls in one bowl and all black in the other? Then, if you pick the first bowl, you have 100% chance, but if you pick the second, 0%. So total probability is 0.5*1 + 0.5*0 = 0.5. That's worse than the previous case. So that's not good.\n\nWait, but the problem says all balls must be distributed. So if I put all white in one bowl, that's 50 white, and 50 black in the other. But then the probability is 0.5*(50/50) + 0.5*(0/50) = 0.5. So same as before.\n\nBut the first approach where I put 1 white in one bowl and the rest in the other gives a higher probability. So maybe that's the way to go.\n\nBut why does that work? Because by putting one white ball in a bowl, you have a 50% chance to get that 100% white bowl, and the other bowl has a high chance of white as well. Wait, but the other bowl has 49 white and 50 black. So the probability there is 49/99, which is about 49.49%, so the average is 50% of 1 + 50% of ~49.49% = ~74.74%.\n\nIs there a better distribution? Let's see. What if I put 2 white balls in one bowl and the rest in the other?\n\nThen, Bowl 1: 2 white, 0 black. Probability is 1 (since 2/2 = 1). Bowl 2: 48 white and 50 black. So 48/98 ≈ 0.4898. Then total probability is 0.5*1 + 0.5*(48/98) ≈ 0.5 + 0.2449 ≈ 0.7449, which is slightly less than the previous case. So worse.\n\nSo putting 1 white in one bowl gives a better result. What if I put 1 white and 1 black in one bowl? Then, the probability for that bowl is 1/2. The other bowl has 49 white and 49 black. So 49/98 = 0.5. Then total probability is 0.5*(0.5) + 0.5*(0.5) = 0.5. Worse again.\n\nSo putting one white in a bowl and the rest in the other seems better. What if I put more than one white in the first bowl but also some black? For example, 1 white and 1 black in the first bowl, and the rest in the second. Wait, that's the same as above, which gives 0.5. Not better.\n\nAlternatively, if I put 1 white in the first bowl, and then in the second bowl, 49 white and 50 black. That's the case we considered earlier. So that gives the highest so far.\n\nIs there a way to get higher than 74.74%? Let's think. Suppose I put 1 white in the first bowl, and then in the second bowl, 49 white and 50 black. Wait, that's the same as before. What if I put 1 white and 0 black in the first bowl, and the rest in the second. That's the same as the first case.\n\nAlternatively, what if I put 1 white and some black in the first bowl? Let's say 1 white and 1 black. Then the probability for that bowl is 1/2. The second bowl has 49 white and 49 black. So 49/98 = 0.5. So total is 0.5*(0.5) + 0.5*(0.5) = 0.5. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, if I put 1 white and 49 black in the first bowl. Then the probability for that bowl is 1/50. The second bowl has 49 white and 1 black. So 49/50. Then total probability is 0.5*(1/50) + 0.5*(49/50) = (1 + 49)/100 = 50/100 = 0.5. Same as before.\n\nSo that's worse than the 74.74% case.\n\nAnother idea: what if I put all the white balls in one bowl and some black in the other? Wait, but that's similar to the case where you have 50 white in one bowl and 50 black in the other. Which gives 0.5 probability. Not better.\n\nAlternatively, if I put 1 white in one bowl and the rest of the white and all black in the other. Which is the case we considered earlier. So that seems better.\n\nIs there a mathematical way to confirm that this is optimal?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote that we have two bowls. Let's say Bowl A has w1 white balls and b1 black balls. Bowl B has w2 white balls and b2 black balls. The total white balls are w1 + w2 = 50, and total black balls are b1 + b2 = 50.\n\nThe probability of picking a white ball is:\n\nP = 0.5 * [w1/(w1 + b1)] + 0.5 * [w2/(w2 + b2)]\n\nWe need to maximize this expression.\n\nTo maximize P, we need to maximize the sum of the two fractions. Since the bowls are chosen with equal probability, we want each fraction to be as high as possible. However, there's a trade-off because moving a white ball from one bowl to another affects both fractions.\n\nBut intuitively, putting as many white balls as possible in one bowl while minimizing the number of black balls in that bowl would help. However, since we have to distribute all balls, we can't have all white in one bowl without having some black in the other.\n\nWait, but if we put one white in one bowl and the rest in the other, that seems to maximize the chance for that first bowl (100%) and the second bowl has as many white as possible relative to black.\n\nAlternatively, if we put more than one white in the first bowl, but then the second bowl would have fewer white balls. For example, if we put 2 white in the first bowl, then the second bowl has 48 white and 50 black. The probability for the second bowl is 48/98 ≈ 0.4898, which is slightly less than 49/99 ≈ 0.4949. So the total probability would be 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(0.4898) ≈ 0.7449, which is less than the case with 1 white in the first bowl.\n\nSo the more white balls we put in the first bowl, the lower the probability of the second bowl becomes, because the second bowl has fewer white balls. Therefore, putting the minimal number of white balls in the first bowl (i.e., 1) to get the maximum probability for that bowl (100%) and then the second bowl has as many white as possible (49) and as few black as possible (50). Wait, but the second bowl has 49 white and 50 black, which is 99 balls. So the probability is 49/99 ≈ 0.4949.\n\nSo the total is 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(49/99) ≈ 0.5 + 0.2474 ≈ 0.7474.\n\nIs there a way to get higher than that? Let's think. Suppose we put 1 white and 0 black in the first bowl, and then in the second bowl, 49 white and 50 black. That's the case we have. What if we put 1 white and 1 black in the first bowl, and then 49 white and 49 black in the second. Then the probabilities are 1/2 and 49/98 = 0.5. So total is 0.5*(0.5) + 0.5*(0.5) = 0.5. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, if we put 1 white and 49 black in the first bowl, then the probability for that bowl is 1/50 = 0.02, and the second bowl has 49 white and 1 black, so 49/50 = 0.98. Then total probability is 0.5*(0.02) + 0.5*(0.98) = 0.01 + 0.49 = 0.5. Same as before.\n\nSo that's worse than the 74.74% case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the general case where we put 1 white in one bowl and the rest in the other. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet’s assume Bowl 1 has 1 white and 0 black. Bowl 2 has 49 white and 50 black. Then:\n\nP = 0.5*(1/1) + 0.5*(49/99) ≈ 0.5 + 0.2474 ≈ 0.7474.\n\nAlternatively, if we put 1 white and x black in Bowl 1, and the rest in Bowl 2. Then:\n\nBowl 1: 1 white, x black. Probability: 1/(1 + x).\n\nBowl 2: 49 white, (50 - x) black. Probability: 49/(49 + 50 - x) = 49/(99 - x).\n\nTotal P = 0.5*[1/(1 + x) + 49/(99 - x)].\n\nWe need to find x that maximizes this expression. Since x is the number of black balls in Bowl 1, which can be from 0 to 50.\n\nLet’s take derivative with respect to x? Wait, but x is an integer, but maybe we can treat it as a continuous variable for approximation.\n\nLet’s denote f(x) = 1/(1 + x) + 49/(99 - x).\n\nTake derivative f’(x) = -1/(1 + x)^2 + 49/(99 - x)^2.\n\nSet derivative to zero:\n\n-1/(1 + x)^2 + 49/(99 - x)^2 = 0\n\n=> 49/(99 - x)^2 = 1/(1 + x)^2\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n49*(1 + x)^2 = (99 - x)^2\n\nTake square roots? Or expand.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft: 49*(1 + 2x + x²) = 49 + 98x + 49x²\n\nRight: (99 - x)^2 = 9801 - 198x + x²\n\nSet equal:\n\n49 + 98x + 49x² = 9801 - 198x + x²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n49 + 98x + 49x² - 9801 + 198x - x² = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(49x² - x²) + (98x + 198x) + (49 - 9801) = 0\n\n48x² + 296x - 9752 = 0\n\nDivide all terms by 8:\n\n6x² + 37x - 1219 = 0\n\nWait, 48/8=6, 296/8=37, 9752/8=1219.\n\nNow solve quadratic equation 6x² + 37x - 1219 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-37 ± sqrt(37² + 4*6*1219)] / (2*6)\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n37² = 1369\n\n4*6*1219 = 24*1219 = Let's compute 24*1200=28800, 24*19=456, total 28800+456=29256\n\nSo discriminant is 1369 + 29256 = 30625\n\nsqrt(30625) = 175\n\nSo x = [-37 ± 175]/12\n\nWe take the positive root:\n\nx = (138)/12 = 11.5\n\nSo x ≈ 11.5. But x must be integer between 0 and 50. So the maximum occurs around x=11.5. Wait, but this contradicts our previous conclusion that x=0 gives the maximum. What's going on here?\n\nWait, this suggests that the maximum of the function f(x) occurs at x≈11.5. But earlier, when we tried x=0, we had a higher probability. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the derivative again.\n\nOriginal function: f(x) = 1/(1 + x) + 49/(99 - x)\n\nDerivative: f’(x) = -1/(1 + x)^2 + 49/(99 - x)^2\n\nSet to zero: -1/(1 + x)^2 + 49/(99 - x)^2 = 0 => 49/(99 - x)^2 = 1/(1 + x)^2\n\nCross-multiplying: 49*(1 + x)^2 = (99 - x)^2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nExpanding:\n\nLeft: 49*(1 + 2x + x²) = 49 + 98x + 49x²\n\nRight: 99² - 2*99*x + x² = 9801 - 198x + x²\n\nSo equation:\n\n49 + 98x + 49x² = 9801 - 198x + x²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n49 + 98x + 49x² - 9801 + 198x - x² = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n(49x² - x²) + (98x + 198x) + (49 - 9801) = 0\n\n48x² + 296x - 9752 = 0\n\nDivide by 8: 6x² + 37x - 1219 = 0\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen discriminant is 37² + 4*6*1219 = 1369 + 29256 = 30625, sqrt(30625)=175.\n\nSo x = [-37 + 175]/12 = 138/12 = 11.5. So x=11.5.\n\nBut this suggests that the maximum of f(x) occurs at x=11.5. However, when we plug x=0, we get f(0)=1 + 49/99 ≈ 1.4949, whereas at x=11.5, f(x)=1/(1+11.5) + 49/(99 - 11.5) = 1/12.5 + 49/87.5 ≈ 0.08 + 0.56 = 0.64. Wait, that's way lower than 1.4949. So why does the derivative suggest that x=11.5 is a critical point?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the function. Wait, the original function f(x) is 1/(1 + x) + 49/(99 - x). But when we take the derivative, we set it to zero, but maybe there's a mistake in the sign?\n\nWait, the derivative was f’(x) = -1/(1 + x)^2 + 49/(99 - x)^2. Setting to zero gives 49/(99 - x)^2 = 1/(1 + x)^2. But solving this gives x≈11.5, but when we plug in x=11.5 into f(x), we get a lower value than at x=0. That suggests that the critical point is a minimum, not a maximum. So perhaps there's a mistake in the derivative calculation?\n\nWait, let's check the derivative again. The function is f(x) = 1/(1 + x) + 49/(99 - x). The derivative of 1/(1 + x) is -1/(1 + x)^2. The derivative of 49/(99 - x) is 49/(99 - x)^2 * derivative of (99 - x) with respect to x, which is -1. Wait, no! Wait, derivative of 49/(99 - x) with respect to x is 49 * derivative of (99 - x)^{-1} = 49 * [1/(99 - x)^2] * derivative of (99 - x) with respect to x, which is -1. So the derivative is 49 * [ -1 / (99 - x)^2 ] = -49/(99 - x)^2.\n\nWait, so earlier I had the derivative as -1/(1 + x)^2 + 49/(99 - x)^2, but actually it should be -1/(1 + x)^2 - 49/(99 - x)^2. Wait, no, let me re-derive:\n\nf(x) = 1/(1 + x) + 49/(99 - x)\n\nf’(x) = d/dx [ (1 + x)^{-1} ] + d/dx [ 49*(99 - x)^{-1} ]\n\nFirst term: -1*(1 + x)^{-2} * 1 = -1/(1 + x)^2\n\nSecond term: 49 * (-1)*(99 - x)^{-2} * (-1) = 49*(99 - x)^{-2} * 1 = 49/(99 - x)^2\n\nWait, because derivative of (99 - x)^{-1} is -1*(99 - x)^{-2} * (-1) = 1/(99 - x)^2. So multiplied by 49, it's 49/(99 - x)^2.\n\nSo the derivative is -1/(1 + x)^2 + 49/(99 - x)^2. Which is what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nBut when I plug in x=0, the derivative is -1/(1)^2 + 49/(99)^2 ≈ -1 + 0.005 ≈ -0.995, which is negative. So the function is decreasing at x=0. If we increase x from 0, the function decreases. But earlier, when I calculated the critical point at x≈11.5, but when I plug in x=11.5, the value of f(x) is lower than at x=0. That suggests that the function has a maximum at x approaching negative infinity? Which doesn't make sense. Wait, this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe the critical point is a minimum? Let me check the second derivative or test around the critical point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck the equation:\n\nFrom 49*(1 + x)^2 = (99 - x)^2\n\nTake square roots: sqrt(49)*(1 + x) = ±(99 - x)\n\nSo 7*(1 + x) = 99 - x or 7*(1 + x) = -(99 - x)\n\nFirst case: 7 + 7x = 99 - x => 8x = 92 => x = 11.5\n\nSecond case: 7 + 7x = -99 + x => 6x = -106 => x = -106/6 ≈ -17.67, which is invalid since x ≥ 0.\n\nSo only x=11.5 is the critical point. But when we plug in x=11.5 into f(x), we get:\n\n1/(1 + 11.5) + 49/(99 - 11.5) = 1/12.5 + 49/87.5 ≈ 0.08 + 0.56 = 0.64, which is much less than f(0) ≈ 1 + 0.4949 ≈ 1.4949. So this suggests that the critical point is a minimum, not a maximum. How is that possible?\n\nWait, the function f(x) = 1/(1 + x) + 49/(99 - x). As x increases from 0 to 50, the first term decreases from 1 to 1/51 ≈ 0.0196, and the second term increases from 49/99 ≈ 0.4949 to 49/(99 - 50) = 49/49 = 1. So the function starts at 1 + 0.4949 ≈ 1.4949, decreases to some minimum, then increases to 0.0196 + 1 = 1.0196. So the minimum is at x=11.5, and the maximum is at the endpoints. Therefore, the maximum of f(x) occurs at x=0 or x=50.\n\nAt x=0, f(x)=1 + 49/99 ≈ 1.4949.\n\nAt x=50, f(x)=1/(1 + 50) + 49/(99 - 50) = 1/51 + 49/49 = 1/51 + 1 ≈ 1.0196.\n\nSo the maximum is at x=0. Therefore, the optimal is to put x=0 black balls in the first bowl, i.e., 1 white and 0 black in Bowl 1, and the rest in Bowl 2. Which matches our initial thought.\n\nSo the earlier calculation of the critical point being a minimum makes sense. Therefore, the maximum occurs at the endpoints, which is x=0. Hence, the optimal distribution is 1 white in one bowl and the rest in the other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to place 1 white ball in one bowl and the remaining 49 white and 50 black balls in the other bowl. This gives the highest probability of approximately 74.74%.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize the probability of selecting a white ball when choosing a random bowl and then a random ball from that bowl, the optimal distribution is as follows:\n\n### **Strategy:**\n- **Bowl 1:** Place **1 white ball**.\n- **Bowl 2:** Place the remaining **49 white balls and 50 black balls**.\n\n### **Probability Calculation:**\n- **Bowl 1:** Since it contains only 1 white ball, the probability of selecting a white ball from this bowl is **1** (100%).\n- **Bowl 2:** It contains 49 white balls and 50 black balls, totaling 99 balls. The probability of selecting a white ball from this bowl is **49/99 ≈ 0.4949**.\n\nSince each bowl is equally likely to be chosen (50% chance), the total probability of selecting a white ball is:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{49}{99} \\approx 0.5 + 0.2474 = 0.7474 \\quad (\\text{or } 74.74\\%).\n$$\n\n### **Why This Works:**\n- By isolating **1 white ball** in a bowl, you guarantee a 100% chance of selecting a white ball if that bowl is chosen.\n- The second bowl, while containing more black balls, still has a relatively high proportion of white balls (49/99), which contributes significantly to the overall probability.\n- Any other distribution (e.g., splitting white balls evenly or adding black balls to the first bowl) reduces the probability of selecting a white ball from one or both bowls.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe optimal distribution is **1 white ball in one bowl** and **49 white balls and 50 black balls in the other bowl**, yielding a **maximum probability of approximately 74.74%**. This strategy leverages the certainty of a single white ball in one bowl while maintaining a high proportion of white balls in the second bowl.",

The total probability becomes 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(49/99) ≈ 74.74%, which is higher than any alternative distribution. Other strategies, such as equal splits or placing all white balls in one bowl, result in lower probabilities.",
