    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the ages of Alok's daughters. So, the problem gives us three hints, and we need to use them step by step. Let me start by breaking down each hint and see how they can help us narrow down the possibilities.\n\nFirst, the product of their ages is 72. That means we need to find all possible triplets of positive integers (a, b, c) where a × b × c = 72. Since they are ages, they should be positive integers, and I assume they are at least 1 year old, though realistically, maybe not too young, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints beyond that. So, let's list all possible triplets.\n\nStarting with 1, 1, 72 (since 1×1×72=72)\nThen 1, 2, 36 (1×2×36=72)\n1, 3, 24\n1, 4, 18\n1, 6, 12\n1, 8, 9\nThen moving to triplets where the first number is 2:\n2, 2, 18 (2×2×18=72)\n2, 3, 12\n2, 4, 9\n2, 6, 6\nThen 3, 3, 8 (3×3×8=72)\n3, 4, 6\nAnd maybe others? Let me check if I missed any. For example, 4, 3, 6 is same as 3,4,6. So I think that's all. Let me count them again to be sure.\n\nSo the possible triplets are:\n\n1,1,72\n1,2,36\n1,3,24\n1,4,18\n1,6,12\n1,8,9\n2,2,18\n2,3,12\n2,4,9\n2,6,6\n3,3,8\n3,4,6\n\nThat's 12 different triplets. Now, the second hint is that the sum of their ages is equal to Alok's house number. Shyam knows the house number but still can't determine the ages. That suggests that there must be multiple triplets with the same sum. Because if the sum was unique, then Shyam would have been able to figure it out immediately. So, the key here is that after knowing the sum (the house number), Shyam still couldn't determine the ages, which implies that the sum corresponds to more than one triplet.\n\nSo, let's calculate the sum for each triplet:\n\n1,1,72: 1+1+72=74\n1,2,36: 1+2+36=39\n1,3,24: 1+3+24=28\n1,4,18: 1+4+18=23\n1,6,12: 1+6+12=19\n1,8,9: 1+8+9=18\n2,2,18: 2+2+18=22\n2,3,12: 2+3+12=17\n2,4,9: 2+4+9=15\n2,6,6: 2+6+6=14\n3,3,8: 3+3+8=14\n3,4,6: 3+4+6=13\n\nNow, looking at these sums, we can see which sums are repeated. The sums that are repeated are 14 (from 2,6,6 and 3,3,8) and 18 (from 1,8,9 and... wait, 18 only appears once here. Wait, 1,8,9 is 18, and others? Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the sums:\n\n74, 39, 28, 23, 19, 18, 22, 17, 15, 14, 14, 13.\n\nSo 14 appears twice (2,6,6 and 3,3,8). All other sums are unique. Therefore, if the house number was 14, Shyam would not be able to determine the ages because there are two possibilities: 2,6,6 and 3,3,8. For any other sum, there's only one triplet, so Shyam would have known the ages. But since Shyam couldn't determine the ages after knowing the sum, that must mean the sum is 14. Therefore, the possible triplets are 2,6,6 and 3,3,8.\n\nNow, the third hint is that the oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. This implies that there is a single oldest daughter. If the triplet was 2,6,6, then there are two oldest daughters, both aged 6. However, if the triplet is 3,3,8, then there is a single oldest daughter aged 8. Therefore, the mention of \"the oldest girl\" (singular) indicates that there is only one oldest daughter, which would be the case in 3,3,8. Therefore, the ages must be 3, 3, and 8, making the oldest girl 8 years old.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The third hint is that the oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. If there were two oldest daughters (both 6), then there would be two oldest girls. But the hint refers to \"the oldest girl\", implying a single oldest. Therefore, the triplet must be 3,3,8, where 8 is the unique oldest. Hence, the answer is 8.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible sums. Wait, earlier I thought that only 14 was repeated. Let me check again. The sums:\n\n1,1,72:74\n1,2,36:39\n1,3,24:28\n1,4,18:23\n1,6,12:19\n1,8,9:18\n2,2,18:22\n2,3,12:17\n2,4,9:15\n2,6,6:14\n3,3,8:14\n3,4,6:13\n\nYes, only 14 is repeated. So the sum must be 14, leading to the two possibilities. Then the third hint resolves it by indicating there's a single oldest, so 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n</think>\n\nThe ages of Alok's daughters can be determined through the process of elimination and logical deduction based on the given hints. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **First Hint (Product of Ages = 72):**  \n   List all possible triplets of positive integers whose product is 72:  \n   (1,1,72), (1,2,36), (1,3,24), (1,4,18), (1,6,12), (1,8,9), (2,2,18), (2,3,12), (2,4,9), (2,6,6), (3,3,8), (3,4,6).\n\n2. **Second Hint (Sum of Ages = House Number):**  \n   Calculate the sum for each triplet:  \n   - (1,1,72): 74  \n   - (1,2,36): 39  \n   - (1,3,24): 28  \n   - (1,4,18): 23  \n   - (1,6,12): 19  \n   - (1,8,9): 18  \n   - (2,2,18): 22  \n   - (2,3,12): 17  \n   - (2,4,9): 15  \n   - (2,6,6): 14  \n   - (3,3,8): 14  \n   - (3,4,6): 13  \n\n   Shyam cannot determine the ages after knowing the sum, which implies the sum must correspond to **multiple triplets**. The only sum that appears more than once is **14**, corresponding to (2,6,6) and (3,3,8).\n\n3. **Third Hint (Oldest Girl Likes Strawberry Ice Cream):**  \n   This indicates there is a **single oldest daughter**. In the triplet (2,6,6), there are **two daughters aged 6**, making them both the oldest. However, in (3,3,8), there is a **unique oldest daughter aged 8**. The mention of \"the oldest girl\" (singular) confirms the triplet must be **(3,3,8)**.\n\n**Answer:** The age of the oldest girl is **8**.",

    "explanation": "Below are all possibilities to get 72 from product of three different ages: \n1 * 1 * 72 = 72 \n1 * 2 * 36 = 72 \n1 * 3 * 24 = 72 \n1 * 4 * 18 = 72 \n1 * 6 * 12 = 72 \n1 * 8 * 9 = 72 \n2 * 2 * 18 = 72 \n2 * 3 * 12 = 72 \n2 * 4 * 9 = 72 \n2 * 6 * 6 = 72 \n3 * 3 * 8 = 72 \n3 * 4 * 6 = 72 \n\n2) Sum of the ages is given \n1 + 1 + 72 = 74 \n1 + 2 + 36 = 39 \n1 + 3 + 24 = 28 \n1 + 4 + 18 = 23 \n1 + 6 + 12 = 19 \n1 + 8 + 9 = 18 \n2 + 2 + 18 = 22 \n2 + 3 + 12 = 17 \n2 + 4 + 9 = 15 \n2 + 6 + 6 = 14 \n3 + 3 + 8 = 14 \n3 + 4 + 6 = 13 \n\nAll sums are unique except 14.
