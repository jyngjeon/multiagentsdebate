    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is asking for the maximum number of people possible given the conditions. Let me start by recalling some set theory principles, maybe the inclusion-exclusion principle. \n\nFirst, let's list out the given information:\n\n- 20 people got full marks in Math (M).\n- 20 in History (H).\n- 20 in Physics (P).\n- 7 people got full marks in both Math and Physics (M ∩ P).\n- 9 in both History and Physics (H ∩ P).\n- 3 people didn't get full marks in any of the subjects.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible total number of people. Hmm, maximum... So, to maximize the total number, we need to minimize the overlaps between the different subjects, right? Because if there are more overlaps, that would mean fewer unique people, but since we want the maximum, we need as few overlaps as possible. Wait, but there are some overlaps already given. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says that 7 people got full marks in both Math and Physics, and 9 in both History and Physics. But what about overlaps between Math and History? The problem doesn't mention that. Also, there's no mention of people who got all three subjects. So, maybe to maximize the total number, we need to assume that there are no overlaps between Math and History, and also no one got all three subjects. Because if there are overlaps in other areas, that would reduce the total number. \n\nLet me try to visualize this with a Venn diagram. There are three circles: Math, History, Physics. The overlaps between Math and Physics are 7, History and Physics are 9. The overlap between Math and History is unknown. Also, the overlap of all three is unknown. But since we want the maximum total, we need to minimize the overlaps. However, the overlaps between Math and Physics and History and Physics are already given. So, perhaps the only overlaps we can adjust are the ones not mentioned. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many people are there at most?\" So, maximum total. To maximize the total, we need to minimize the overlaps between the different sets. However, the overlaps between Math and Physics and between History and Physics are fixed. So, maybe the only way to maximize the total is to assume that there is no overlap between Math and History, and also no one is in all three subjects. Because if there is an overlap between Math and History, that would reduce the total number. Similarly, if someone is in all three, that would also reduce the total. \n\nSo, let's proceed with that assumption. Let me denote:\n\nLet’s use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets:\n\nTotal = M + H + P - (M∩P + M∩H + H∩P) + (M∩H∩P) + Neither\n\nBut we need to find the maximum total. Wait, but the formula is:\n\nTotal = |M ∪ H ∪ P| + Neither\n\nAnd |M ∪ H ∪ P| = |M| + |H| + |P| - |M∩P| - |M∩H| - |H∩P| + |M∩H∩P|\n\nSo, substituting the known values:\n\n|M ∪ H ∪ P| = 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - 9 - |M∩H| + |M∩H∩P|\n\nBut we don't know |M∩H| or |M∩H∩P|. However, since we want to maximize the total number of people, which is |M ∪ H ∪ P| + 3 (the neither group), we need to maximize |M ∪ H ∪ P|. To do that, we need to minimize the overlaps. \n\nWait, but in the formula, |M ∪ H ∪ P| is equal to the sum of the individual sets minus the pairwise overlaps plus the triple overlap. So, to maximize |M ∪ H ∪ P|, we need to minimize the overlaps. However, the overlaps that are subtracted are the pairwise overlaps. So, if we can minimize the pairwise overlaps, that would increase |M ∪ H ∪ P|. But we already have fixed overlaps for M∩P and H∩P. The only variable is M∩H and M∩H∩P. \n\nWait, but the problem says that 7 people are in both M and P, and 9 in H and P. But what about M and H? If we can assume that there is no overlap between M and H, then |M∩H| = 0. Also, if we assume that there is no one in all three, then |M∩H∩P| = 0. \n\nSo, substituting:\n\n|M ∪ H ∪ P| = 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - 9 - 0 + 0 = 60 - 16 = 44\n\nThen total people would be 44 + 3 = 47. \n\nBut wait, is that possible? Let me check if the numbers make sense. For example, the overlap between M and P is 7. So, in the Math set, there are 20 people. If 7 are also in Physics, then the number of people only in Math is 20 - 7 = 13. Similarly, in Physics, there are 20 people. The overlaps with Math and History are 7 and 9, so the number of people only in Physics would be 20 - 7 - 9 = 4. Wait, but if there's no overlap between Math and History, then the overlap between History and Physics is 9, so in History, there are 20 people. The overlap with Physics is 9, so the number of people only in History is 20 - 9 = 11. \n\nThen, adding up all the unique parts:\n\nOnly Math: 13\n\nOnly History: 11\n\nOnly Physics: 4\n\nMath and Physics only: 7 - but wait, if there's no one in all three, then the overlap between M and P is exactly those 7. Similarly, the overlap between H and P is 9. \n\nThen, the total in the union would be 13 + 11 + 4 + 7 + 9 + ... Wait, but what about the overlap between Math and History? If there's no overlap, then there's no other overlaps. So, the total would be:\n\nOnly Math: 13\n\nOnly History: 11\n\nOnly Physics: 4\n\nMath and Physics: 7\n\nHistory and Physics: 9\n\nMath and History: 0\n\nAll three: 0\n\nSo, adding those up: 13 + 11 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 44. Then adding the 3 who didn't get any, total is 47. \n\nBut wait, let me check if the numbers for each subject are correct. For Math: only Math (13) + Math and Physics (7) = 20. Correct. For History: only History (11) + History and Physics (9) = 20. Correct. For Physics: only Physics (4) + Math and Physics (7) + History and Physics (9) = 4 + 7 + 9 = 20. Correct. \n\nSo that seems to check out. Therefore, the maximum number of people is 47. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the maximum number of people. Is there a way to get a higher number? Let me think. Suppose there is an overlap between Math and History. If there is an overlap, that would mean that some people are counted in both Math and History, which would reduce the total number of unique people. Therefore, to maximize the total, we need to have as little overlap as possible. Hence, assuming that there is no overlap between Math and History, and no one is in all three, gives the maximum total. \n\nAlternatively, if there was an overlap between Math and History, that would mean that some people are in both, which would subtract more from the total, leading to a smaller |M ∪ H ∪ P|. Therefore, the maximum occurs when those overlaps are zero. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 47. \n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose that there are some people in all three subjects. How would that affect the total? Let's say there are x people in all three. Then, the overlaps between M and P would include those x people. Similarly for H and P. But the problem states that the overlap between M and P is 7. So, if there are x people in all three, then the number of people in both M and P but not H would be 7 - x. Similarly, the overlap between H and P would be 9 - x. \n\nBut if we include x in the triple overlap, then the formula for |M ∪ H ∪ P| would be:\n\n20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - 9 - |M∩H| + x\n\nBut if we want to maximize |M ∪ H ∪ P|, we need to minimize the overlaps. However, if we have x people in all three, then the overlaps between M and P and H and P are already accounting for x. So, if we have x people in all three, then the pairwise overlaps (M∩P and H∩P) would be 7 and 9, which include those x. Therefore, if we have x people in all three, then the number of people in only M and P is 7 - x, and only H and P is 9 - x. \n\nBut if we want to minimize the overlaps, perhaps we need to maximize x? Wait, no. Because if we have more people in all three, that would mean that the overlaps between the pairs are already including those people, so maybe that allows us to have less overlap in other areas? Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf we have x people in all three, then the pairwise overlaps (M∩P, H∩P, M∩H) would each include those x people. However, the problem states that M∩P is 7 and H∩P is 9. So, if there are x people in all three, then the number of people in both M and P but not H is 7 - x, and the number in both H and P but not M is 9 - x. Similarly, if there are y people in both M and H but not P, then the total overlap between M and H would be y + x. \n\nBut since we want to maximize the total number of people, we need to minimize the overlaps. However, the overlaps between M and P and H and P are fixed at 7 and 9. So, if we have x people in all three, then the overlaps between M and P and H and P are already fixed. Therefore, the only variable is the overlap between M and H. If we can set that to zero, then the total |M ∪ H ∪ P| would be:\n\n20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - 9 - 0 + x\n\nWait, but the formula is:\n\n|M ∪ H ∪ P| = |M| + |H| + |P| - |M∩P| - |M∩H| - |H∩P| + |M∩H∩P|\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n= 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - |M∩H| - 9 + x\n\n= 60 - 16 - |M∩H| + x\n\n= 44 - |M∩H| + x\n\nTo maximize |M ∪ H ∪ P|, we need to minimize |M∩H| and maximize x. But |M∩H| can't be negative. The minimum |M∩H| is 0. However, x can't be more than the minimum of the overlaps. For example, since |M∩P| is 7, and |H∩P| is 9, the maximum x can be is 7 (since you can't have more people in all three than in the overlap between M and P). So, if x is 7, then the overlap between M and P is 7, which includes all 7 in all three. Then, the overlap between H and P is 9, which includes x=7, so the number of people in H and P but not M is 9 - 7 = 2. \n\nBut if we set x=7, then |M ∪ H ∪ P| becomes 44 - 0 + 7 = 51. Then total people would be 51 + 3 = 54. Wait, that's higher than 47. But that seems contradictory. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, no. If x is the number of people in all three, then the formula is:\n\n|M ∪ H ∪ P| = 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - |M∩H| - 9 + x\n\nBut if we set |M∩H| to 0, and x to 7, then:\n\n= 60 - 7 - 0 - 9 + 7 = 60 - 16 + 7 = 51. \n\nBut then, how does that work with the individual subject counts?\n\nLet me check. If x=7 (all three), then:\n\n- In Math: 20 people. These include those in all three (7), those in Math and Physics only (7 - x = 0?), wait, no. Wait, the overlap between M and P is 7, which includes those in all three. So if x=7, then the number of people in both M and P but not H is 7 - x = 0. Similarly, the overlap between H and P is 9, which includes x=7, so the number in H and P but not M is 9 - 7 = 2. \n\nThen, the number of people in all three is 7. \n\nNow, for Math: total is 20. This includes:\n\n- Only Math: ?\n\n- Math and Physics only: 0\n\n- Math and History only: ?\n\n- All three: 7\n\nSimilarly, for History: 20 includes:\n\n- Only History: ?\n\n- History and Physics only: 2\n\n- History and Math only: ?\n\n- All three: 7\n\nFor Physics: 20 includes:\n\n- Only Physics: ?\n\n- Math and Physics only: 0\n\n- History and Physics only: 2\n\n- All three: 7\n\nSo, let's calculate the numbers:\n\nFor Math:\n\nTotal = Only Math + Math and Physics only + Math and History only + All three\n\n20 = Only Math + 0 + Math and History only + 7\n\nSo, Only Math + Math and History only = 13\n\nSimilarly, for History:\n\n20 = Only History + 2 + Math and History only + 7\n\nSo, Only History + Math and History only = 11\n\nFor Physics:\n\n20 = Only Physics + 0 + 2 + 7\n\nSo, Only Physics = 20 - 9 = 11\n\nNow, we have:\n\nOnly Physics = 11\n\nFrom Math: Only Math + Math and History only = 13\n\nFrom History: Only History + Math and History only = 11\n\nLet’s denote Math and History only as y. Then:\n\nOnly Math = 13 - y\n\nOnly History = 11 - y\n\nNow, the total number of people in the union is:\n\nOnly Math + Only History + Only Physics + Math and Physics only + History and Physics only + Math and History only + All three\n\nWhich is:\n\n(13 - y) + (11 - y) + 11 + 0 + 2 + y + 7\n\nSimplify:\n\n13 - y + 11 - y + 11 + 0 + 2 + y + 7\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n13 + 11 + 11 + 2 + 7 + (-y - y + y) = 44 + (-y)\n\nSo, total union is 44 - y\n\nBut earlier, using the formula, we had |M ∪ H ∪ P| = 51. But according to this breakdown, it's 44 - y. So, 44 - y = 51? That would mean y = -7, which is impossible. There's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier calculation was wrong. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me recalculate the formula. The formula was:\n\n|M ∪ H ∪ P| = 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - |M∩H| - 9 + x\n\nBut |M∩H| is the total overlap between Math and History, which includes those in all three. So, if x is the number in all three, and y is the number in Math and History only, then |M∩H| = y + x. \n\nBut in the previous calculation, I set |M∩H| = 0, but that would mean y + x = 0. However, if x=7, then y would have to be -7, which is impossible. Therefore, my mistake was assuming that |M∩H| can be zero when x is 7. That's not possible because |M∩H| must be at least x, since the overlap between M and H includes those in all three. \n\nTherefore, if x is the number in all three, then |M∩H| must be at least x. Therefore, if we want to minimize |M∩H|, we need to set it equal to x. So, if we set |M∩H| = x, then the formula becomes:\n\n|M ∪ H ∪ P| = 60 - 7 - x - 9 + x = 60 - 16 = 44. \n\nSo, regardless of x, if |M∩H| = x, then the total union is 44. Therefore, even if we have people in all three, as long as |M∩H| is set to x, the total union remains 44. Therefore, the maximum total number of people is still 44 + 3 = 47. \n\nThis suggests that my initial calculation was correct, and trying to set x to 7 was invalid because it would require |M∩H| to be less than x, which is impossible. Therefore, the maximum total is indeed 47. \n\nAnother way to think about it: the overlaps between M and P and H and P are fixed. The only other overlap is between M and H, which we can set to zero if there are no people in all three. If there are people in all three, then the overlap between M and H must be at least that number, which would increase the subtracted term in the inclusion-exclusion formula, thereby decreasing the total union. Hence, to maximize the total, we need to have no overlap between M and H and no one in all three. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of people is 47.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the **maximum number of people** given the constraints, we apply the **principle of inclusion-exclusion** for three sets. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Given:**\n- **Math (M):** 20 people  \n- **History (H):** 20 people  \n- **Physics (P):** 20 people  \n- **M ∩ P:** 7 people  \n- **H ∩ P:** 9 people  \n- **Neither M, H, nor P:** 3 people  \n\nWe are to **maximize** the total number of people, which is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total} = |M \\cup H \\cup P| + \\text{Neither}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Use Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n$$\n|M \\cup H \\cup P| = |M| + |H| + |P| - |M \\cap P| - |H \\cap P| - |M \\cap H| + |M \\cap H \\cap P|\n$$\n\nWe are given:\n- $ |M| = 20 $\n- $ |H| = 20 $\n- $ |P| = 20 $\n- $ |M \\cap P| = 7 $\n- $ |H \\cap P| = 9 $\n\nLet:\n- $ x = |M \\cap H| $ (unknown)\n- $ y = |M \\cap H \\cap P| $ (unknown)\n\nSubstitute into the formula:\n\n$$\n|M \\cup H \\cup P| = 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - 9 - x + y = 60 - 16 - x + y = 44 - x + y\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Maximize the Total**\n\nTo **maximize** the total number of people, we need to **maximize** $ |M \\cup H \\cup P| $, which means we must **minimize** $ x $ and **maximize** $ y $.\n\n- **Minimizing $ x $:** The smallest possible value of $ x $ is 0 (no overlap between M and H).\n- **Maximizing $ y $:** The largest possible value of $ y $ is the minimum of the overlaps already given, i.e., $ \\min(|M \\cap P|, |H \\cap P|) = 7 $.\n\nHowever, if $ y = 7 $, then $ x $ must be **at least** 7 (since $ y \\leq x $), which contradicts the assumption that $ x = 0 $.
