    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking for the maximum number of distinct natural numbers that can add up to 100. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, natural numbers are positive integers, right? So we're talking about numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc. The key here is that they have to be distinct, meaning no repeats. And we want as many of them as possible such that their sum is exactly 100.\n\nI remember that to maximize the number of terms, you want to use the smallest possible numbers because they add up more slowly. For example, if you use 1, 2, 3, ..., n, the sum is n(n+1)/2. So maybe I need to find the largest n such that this sum is less than or equal to 100. Then, if there's a remainder, adjust the largest number to make up the difference.\n\nLet me test this idea. Let's calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers and see when it's just below 100.\n\nStarting with n=1: sum=1\nn=2: 3\nn=3: 6\nn=4: 10\nn=5: 15\nn=6: 21\nn=7: 28\nn=8: 36\nn=9: 45\nn=10: 55\nn=11: 66\nn=12: 78\nn=13: 91\nn=14: 105\n\nOh, so when n=13, the sum is 91, which is less than 100. Then n=14 gives 105, which is over 100. So the maximum number of terms would be 13, but we need to adjust the last term to make the total sum 100 instead of 91. The difference is 100 - 91 = 9. So instead of the last term being 13, we can add 9 to it, making it 13 + 9 = 22. But wait, does that keep all numbers distinct?\n\nLet me check. The numbers would be 1, 2, 3, ..., 12, 22. Are all these numbers distinct? Yes, because 22 is larger than 12, and all previous numbers are unique. So that works. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct natural numbers is 13.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to get more than 13 numbers? Let me think. Suppose instead of adding 9 to the last term, we distribute the extra 9 among the numbers. But since all numbers have to be distinct, we can't just add 1 to some numbers because that might cause duplicates. For example, if we take the sum up to 13 (which is 91) and need 9 more. If we add 1 to the last number, making it 14, the sum becomes 91 +1=92. Then we still need 8 more. But adding 1 to the next number would make it 13, but 13 is already in the sequence. Wait, no, the original numbers are 1 to 13. If we add 1 to the last term (13 becomes 14), then the numbers are 1-12 and 14. Then, if we need 8 more, maybe we can add 8 to the last term? Wait, that would be 14 +8=22, which is the same as before. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can adjust multiple numbers. For example, instead of just increasing the last number by 9, we can increase some numbers by smaller amounts. But since all numbers must remain distinct, we have to ensure that after adjustment, no duplicates occur. For instance, if we take the sum 1+2+...+13=91, and need 9 more. Let's try adding 1 to the last number (13 becomes 14), which gives us 92. Then we need 8 more. If we add 1 to the second last number (12 becomes 13), but 13 is already in the list (originally 13 was there, but we changed it to 14). Wait, no, the original numbers were 1-13. If we change 13 to 14, then the numbers are 1-12 and 14. Then, if we add 1 to 12, making it 13, which is not in the list anymore (since 13 was changed to 14). So that would be okay. Then the numbers would be 1-11, 13, 14. Wait, but then the sum would be 91 -13 +13 +14? No, original sum was 91. If we take the original numbers 1-13 (sum 91), then change 13 to 14 (sum becomes 91 -13 +14 = 92). Then change 12 to 13 (sum becomes 92 -12 +13 = 93). Then we need 7 more. Next, change 11 to 12? But 12 was changed to 13. Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe this approach isn't better. It might end up requiring more numbers, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to choose numbers that aren't starting from 1. For example, if we skip some small numbers to allow more numbers later. But intuitively, starting from 1 gives the minimal sum for a given number of terms, so that should allow the maximum number of terms. If you skip a small number, you have to compensate with larger numbers, which might reduce the total count.\n\nWait, let's test that. Suppose instead of using 1, we use 2, 3, ..., n. Then the sum is (n(n+1)/2) -1. But that would be a larger sum for the same number of terms, so maybe not helpful. Alternatively, maybe using some combination where you skip a number to allow adding more numbers. But I think that's not possible because the minimal sum for n numbers is 1+2+...+n. If you use any other set of distinct numbers, the sum would be larger. Therefore, to have the sum be 100, the minimal sum for n numbers must be ≤100. Hence, the maximum n is the largest n where 1+2+...+n ≤100. Which we found as n=13 (sum 91). Then, by adjusting the largest number, we can reach 100.\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to have more than 13 numbers. Suppose we take numbers starting from 1, but instead of going up to 13, we have some numbers that are not consecutive. For example, maybe replacing some larger numbers with smaller ones? Wait, but if we have more numbers, we need to have smaller numbers. Wait, but if we have 14 numbers, the minimal sum would be 1+2+...+14 = 105, which is already more than 100. Therefore, it's impossible to have 14 distinct natural numbers summing to 100 because even the minimal sum for 14 numbers is 105, which is over 100. Therefore, 13 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The minimal sum for 14 numbers is 105, which is greater than 100, so no way to have 14 numbers. Therefore, 13 is the maximum. Hence, the answer is 13.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose we don't take the consecutive numbers. For example, if we take numbers 1, 2, 3,..., 12, and then instead of 13, take a smaller number. Wait, but all numbers have to be distinct. If we take numbers up to 12, sum is 78. Then we need 22 more. If we take 22 as the next number, that's 78 +22=100. So that's 13 numbers: 1-12 and 22. Which is the same as before. Alternatively, could we split the 22 into smaller numbers? For example, instead of 22, use 13 and 9. But 13 is not in the previous numbers (since we have up to 12). Wait, 13 is not in 1-12, so adding 13 and 9 would be 1-12, 9, 13. But 9 is already in 1-12. So that would duplicate 9. Not allowed. Alternatively, split 22 into numbers not in the existing set. For example, 14 and 8. But 8 is already in the set. Hmm. How about 14 and 8? No, 8 is already there. 15 and 7? 7 is there. 16 and 6? 6 is there. 17 and 5? 5 is there. 18 and 4? 4 is there. 19 and 3? 3 is there. 20 and 2? 2 is there. 21 and 1? 1 is there. So all these splits would duplicate numbers. Therefore, we can't split 22 into two numbers without duplicating. Therefore, we have to use a single number, 22, which is not in the existing set. Hence, 13 numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take some other combination. For example, instead of 1-12 and 22, maybe take some numbers that are not starting from 1. Let's say we skip 1 and take higher numbers. But that would make the sum larger, so probably not helpful. For example, if we take 2-13, sum is (sum 1-13) -1 = 91 -1 = 90. Then we need 10 more. So add 10 to the last number, making it 13 +10=23. Then numbers are 2-12, 23. That's 12 numbers. Which is less than 13. So worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take some numbers with gaps. For example, take 1, 2, 3,..., 11, then skip 12 and take some numbers. Let's see. The sum up to 11 is 66. Then we need 34 more. If we take numbers larger than 11. Let's say 12, 13, etc. But if we take 12, that's 66 +12=78. Then need 22 more. Take 13: 78+13=91. Then need 9 more. Take 9? But 9 is already in the set. So can't. Take 14: 91 +14=105, which is over. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, take 12 and 22. 66 +12 +22=100. That's 1,2,...,11,12,22. Which is 12 numbers. Less than 13. So worse.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as an optimization. To maximize the number of terms, we need the numbers to be as small as possible. Therefore, the optimal set is the first n natural numbers, adjusted if necessary. Since the sum of the first n numbers is n(n+1)/2. We need this sum to be as close to 100 as possible without exceeding it. Then adjust the largest number to make the total sum 100.\n\nAs calculated before, n=13 gives sum 91, which is 9 less than 100. So replacing the last number (13) with 13 +9=22. This gives us 13 numbers. Since n=14 gives sum 105 which is over 100, we can't have 14 numbers. Therefore, 13 is the maximum.\n\nBut let me check another way. Suppose we have k distinct numbers. The minimal sum is 1+2+...+k = k(k+1)/2. We need this minimal sum to be ≤100. So solving k(k+1)/2 ≤100. Multiply both sides by 2: k² +k ≤200. So k² +k -200 ≤0. Solving quadratic equation k² +k -200=0. Using quadratic formula: k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 800)] /2 = [-1 ± sqrt(801)] /2. sqrt(801) is approx 28.3. So positive root is ( -1 +28.3)/2 ≈27.3/2≈13.65. So k must be less than or equal to 13.65, so maximum integer k is 13. Therefore, confirming that 13 is the maximum number of terms. Hence, the answer is 13.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of distinct natural numbers that sum to 100 is 13.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the **maximum number of distinct natural numbers** that sum to **100**, we must consider the following:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insight:**\nTo **maximize the number of terms**, we should use the **smallest possible distinct natural numbers**. This is because smaller numbers contribute less to the total sum, allowing us to include more terms before reaching the target sum of 100.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Use the Sum of the First $ n $ Natural Numbers**\n\nThe sum of the first $ n $ natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nS = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\n\nWe want the largest $ n $ such that this sum is **less than or equal to 100**.\n\n$$\n\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\leq 100\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n$$\nn(n+1) \\leq 200\n$$\n\nSolve the quadratic inequality:\n\n$$\nn^2 + n - 200 \\leq 0\n$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 800}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{801}}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{801} \\approx 28.3 \\Rightarrow n \\approx \\frac{-1 + 28.3}{2} \\approx 13.65\n$$\n\nSo the **largest integer $ n $** satisfying the inequality is:\n\n$$\nn = 13\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verify the Sum of the First 13 Natural Numbers**\n\n$$\n\\frac{13 \\cdot 14}{2} = 91\n$$\n\nThis is **9 less than 100**. To adjust, we can **replace the largest number (13)** with a number that is **9 more** than 13, i.e., **22**.\n\nNow the set becomes:\n\n$$\n\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 12, 22\\}\n$$\n\nThis set contains **13 distinct natural numbers**, and their sum is:\n\n$$\n91 - 13 + 22 = 100\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Can We Use More Than 13 Numbers?**\n\nIf we try $ n = 14 $, the minimal sum is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{14 \\cdot 15}{2} = 105\n$$\n\nThis is **greater than 100**, so it's **impossible** to use 14 distinct natural numbers to sum to 100.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe **maximum number of distinct natural numbers** that can sum to **100** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{13}\n$$",
