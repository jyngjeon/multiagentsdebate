    "base_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about apples that lose water over time, changing their water content percentage. The initial weight is 1 ton, which is 90% water. After some days, the water content drops to 80%, and we need to find the new weight.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that when something loses water, the non-water part (the dry mass) remains the same, right? So the apples are losing water, but the solid part stays constant. That makes sense because water evaporates, but the actual apple flesh doesn't disappear.\n\nSo, initially, the apples are 90% water. That means 10% is the dry mass. Let me calculate the dry mass first. If the total weight is 1 ton, which is 1000 kg, then 10% of that is 100 kg. So the dry mass is 100 kg. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, after some time, the water content is 80%. That means the dry mass is now 20% of the total weight. Wait, because if water is 80%, then the remaining 20% must be the dry mass. So the dry mass is still 100 kg, but now it's 20% of the total weight. So I can set up an equation where 20% of the new total weight equals 100 kg.\n\nLet me write that out. Let the new total weight be x. Then 0.20 * x = 100 kg. Solving for x would give x = 100 / 0.20 = 500 kg. So the new weight is 500 kg. That seems like a big drop, but considering the water content decreased from 90% to 80%, which is a significant change, maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the percentages. Let me verify. Initially, 90% water, so 10% dry. 10% of 1000 kg is 100 kg. Then, after drying, the dry mass is still 100 kg, but now it's 20% of the total weight. So total weight is 100 kg divided by 0.2, which is 500 kg. That seems right.\n\nBut sometimes these problems can be counterintuitive. For example, if you have something that's 99% water and it dries to 98%, the weight halves, which is a common example. So maybe this is similar. Here, going from 90% to 80% water, the weight reduces from 1000 kg to 500 kg. That seems like a big drop, but mathematically, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it by calculating the water content before and after. Initially, water is 900 kg (90% of 1000 kg). Then, after drying, the water is 80% of the new weight. Let me denote the new total weight as x. Then, the water is 0.8x, and the dry mass is 0.2x. But the dry mass is still 100 kg, so 0.2x = 100 kg, leading to x = 500 kg. The water would then be 0.8*500 = 400 kg. So the total weight is 400 kg water + 100 kg dry = 500 kg. That adds up.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the amount of water lost is 900 kg - 400 kg = 500 kg. So the apples lost 500 kg of water, which is half of the original weight. That seems a lot, but again, the math is consistent.\n\nI think the key here is that the dry mass remains constant, and the percentage of dry mass increases as the water percentage decreases. So even though the water percentage only dropped by 10 percentage points, the actual weight loss is significant because the dry mass is a smaller proportion of the total weight initially. So the answer should be 500 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of the apples after the water content decreases to 80% is **500 kg**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Composition**:  \n   - Total weight = 1 ton (1000 kg).  \n   - Water = 90% of 1000 kg = **900 kg**.  \n   - Dry mass = 10% of 1000 kg = **100 kg**.  \n\n2. **After Drying**:  \n   - The dry mass remains **100 kg** (water evaporates, but solids stay).  \n   - The new water content is **80%**, so the dry mass becomes **20%** of the total weight.  \n\n3. **Calculate New Total Weight**:  \n   Let the new total weight be $ x $.  \n   $ 20\\% \\times x = 100 \\, \\text{kg} $  \n   $ 0.2x = 100 $  \n   $ x = \\frac{100}{0.2} = 500 \\, \\text{kg} $.  \n\n**Final Answer**: The apples now weigh **500 kg**.  \n\nThis result highlights how a small percentage change in water content (from 90% to 80%) leads to a significant reduction in total weight because the dry mass becomes a larger proportion of the total.",

After a few days, this non-water content makes up 20% of the total weight (because the water content has reduced to 80%).
