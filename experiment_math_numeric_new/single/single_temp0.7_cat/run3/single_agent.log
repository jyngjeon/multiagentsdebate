  "reasoning": "To find the distance between points P and Q, we need to consider the dimensions of the rectangular box. Point P is at the center of one square base, so it's located at (8, 8, 2) if we assume the bottom left corner of the base is at (0, 0, 0). Point Q is at a corner of the opposite base, which would be at (0, 16, 4) given that the thickness of the box is 4 cm. We can use the 3D distance formula to find the distance between these two points: \n\ndistance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of P and Q into this formula gives us:\n\nsqrt((0 - 8)^2 + (16 - 8)^2 + (4 - 2)^2) = sqrt(64 + 64 + 4) = sqrt(132) = 2*sqrt(33)",

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 79. Extracted: {"answer": 1820}

Reasoning:
To maximize the volume of the remaining block of cheese, we need to minimize the volume of the slices removed. Since each slice has a width of 1 cm, the minimum volume for each slice would occur if they were cut as thin as possible (i.e., with a thickness of 1 cm) and were parallel to the largest faces of the cheese. However, the problem specifies that the slices do not necessarily need to be parallel to each other.

Given that we can choose the orientation of each slice, the optimal strategy is to cut slices that have dimensions of \(1 \times 13 \times 14\) cm, which is the smallest possible volume per slice when considering the different orientations.

Each such slice will have a volume of:
\[ 1 \times 13 \times 14 = 182 \text{ cubic cm} \]

If we cut 10 such slices, the total volume of the slices removed is:
\[ 10 \times 182 = 1820 \text{ cubic cm} \]

The original volume of the cheese block is:
\[ 10 \times 13 \times 14 = 1820 \text{ cubic cm} \]

Thus, if we remove 1820 cubic cm of cheese, the remaining volume is:
\[ 1820 - 1820 = 0 \text{ cubic cm} \]

However, since we want the maximum possible volume of the remaining block of cheese, we should consider cutting slices that do not completely remove the cheese but still minimize the volume removed. If we cut slices parallel to the smallest face, i.e., \(10 \times 1 \times 1 = 10\) cubic cm, the maximum volume left would be:
\[ 1820 - 10 \times 10 = 1820 - 100 = 1720 \text{ cubic cm} \]

Therefore, the maximum possible volume of the remaining block of cheese is:
\[ \boxed{1820 - 100 = 1720 \text{ cubic cm}} \]

Upon reevaluation, the correct interpretation should be to minimize the volume of slices removed while ensuring the cheese block remains intact. Hence, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1820 - 10 \times 10 = 1720 \text{ cubic cm}} \]

Thus, the final maximum volume of the remaining cheese block is:
\[ \boxed{1720}
