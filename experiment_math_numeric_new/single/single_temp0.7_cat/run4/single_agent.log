Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 16. Extracted: {"answer": 25}

Reasoning:
- Given that \(AE = 40\) cm and \(BE = 20\) cm, we can determine that \(AB = AE - BE = 40 - 20 = 20\) cm.
- We know \(AD = 30\) cm and since \(A\) to \(D\) covers \(AB + BD\), then \(BD = AD - AB = 30 - 20 = 10\) cm.
- \(C\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BD}\). Therefore, \(BC = CD = \frac{1}{2} BD = \frac{1}{2}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 79. Extracted: {"answer": 1820}

Reasoning:
To maximize the volume of the remaining block of cheese, we need to minimize the total volume of the slices that are cut off. Since each slice has a volume of $1 \text{ cm}^2 \times \text{length}$ (where the length can vary depending on which face it's parallel to), the best way to minimize the loss is to ensure that the slices do not overlap and are as thin as possible, i.e., $1$ cm wide. 

Given the dimensions of the cheese block ($10$ cm by $13$ cm by $14$ cm), the total volume of the cheese before any slices are cut is:
\[ V = 10 \times 13 \times 14 = 1820 \text{ cm}^3 \]

If we cut 10 slices, each with a volume of $1 \text{ cm}^3 \times \text{length}$, the minimum volume lost per slice would be $1 \text{ cm}^2 \times 1 \text{ cm} = 1 \text{ cm}^3$. Thus, the total volume lost by cutting 10 slices is:
\[ 10 \times 1 = 10 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Therefore, the maximum possible volume of the remaining block of cheese is:
\[ 1820 - 10 = 1810 \text{ cm}^3 \]

However, the question asks for the maximum possible volume in cubic cm of the remaining block of cheese after ten slices have been cut off, which means we should consider the possibility that the slices might be cut such that they do not reduce the overall volume more than necessary. If the slices are optimally placed without overlapping, the volume removed is indeed minimized to 10 cm³.

Thus, the maximum possible volume of the remaining cheese is:
\[ 1820 - 10 = 1810 \text{ cm}^3 \]

But since the question asks for the maximum possible volume, and considering the optimal placement of slices, the answer remains consistent with the original total volume minus the minimal slices:
\[ 1820 - 10 = 1810 \]

Therefore, the correct interpretation is:
\[ 1820 \text{ cm}

k^2 - 2 \cdot 10^9 k - 3k + 10^{18} + 2 \cdot 10^9 + 1 \approx 0.

k \approx 10^9 / 2 = 500,000,000.
