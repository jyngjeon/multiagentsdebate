Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 8. Extracted: {"answer": 6.5}

To solve this problem:

1. We start by noting the relationship between the energy \(E\) of a photon and its wavelength \(\lambda\): \(E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

2. Let's denote the energy of the red photon as \(E_r\) and its wavelength as \(\lambda_r = 7 \times 10^{-7}\) meters. If another photon has an energy 2000 times greater than \(E_r\), then its energy \(E_p\) is \(2000E_r\).

3. Since energy is inversely proportional to wavelength, we have:
   \[
   E_p = 2000E_r \implies \frac{1}{\lambda_p} = 2000 \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda_r}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \lambda_p = \frac{\lambda_r}{2000} = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2000}
   \]

4. Simplify \(\lambda_p\):
   \[
   \lambda_p = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2000} = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 10^3} = \frac{7}{2} \times 10^{-7-3} = 3.5 \times 10^{-10}
   \]

5. In scientific notation, \(3.5 \times 10^{-10}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {"answer": -4}

To solve this problem, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

1. **Condition Analysis:**

   - **Property 1:** $z_1$ and $z_2$ are not real.
   
   - **Property 2:** $z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n$ for all integers $n \geq 1$.
   
   - **Property 3:** $\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}$ is real for all integers $n \geq 1$.
   
   - **Property 4:** $\left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = 2$.

2. **Expressing Terms:**
   
   From Property 2:
   \[
   z_3 = z_2^2 z_1,
   \]
   \[
   z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^4 z_1^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2,
   \]
   \[
   z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{10} z_1^4 z_2^2 z_1 = z_2^{12} z_1^5.
   \]

3. **Magnitude Conditions:**
   
   Using Property 4:
   \[
   \left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2}\right| = \left|\frac{z_1}{z_2^3 z_1}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{z_2^3}\right| = 2,
   \]
   which implies
   \[
   |z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]
   
   Similarly,
   \[
   \left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = \left|\frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^{12} z_1^5}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^3}\right| = 2,
   \]
   which implies
   \[
   |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

4. **Solving Magnitude Equations:**

   We have two equations involving magnitudes:
   \[
   |z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2},
   \]
   \[
   |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

   Substitute $|z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2}$ into the second equation:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{7}{3}} |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2},
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{2^{\frac{7}{3}}} |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2},
   \]
   \[
   |z_1|^3 = 2^{\frac{7}{3} - 1} = 2^{\frac{4}{3}},
   \]
   \[
   |z_1| = 2^{\frac{4}{9}}.
   \]

5. **Real Condition:**

   Since $\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}$ is real, we use the property that if $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers such that $\frac{a}{b}$ is real, then $\arg(a) - \arg(b)$ is an integer multiple of $\pi$.

6. **Possible Values of $z_1$:**

   Let $z_1 = re^{i\theta}$ where $r = 2^{\frac{4}{9}}$ and $\theta$ is to be determined. Given $z_2$ is also not real, we need to find angles $\theta$ such that $\arg(z_1) + 2\arg(z_2) = k\pi$ for some integer $k$. Considering symmetry and periodicity in the argument, the possible values of $\theta$ are $\pm \frac{\pi}{3}, \pm \frac{2\pi}{3}$.

   Thus, the possible values of $z_1$ are:
   \[
   z_1 = 2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}}, \quad z_1 = 2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{-i\frac{\pi}{3}}, \quad z_1 = 2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}, \quad z_1 = 2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}}.
   \]

7. **Product of All Possible Values:**

   The product of these values is:
   \[
   \left(2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}}\right) \left(2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{-i\frac{\pi}{3}}\right) \left(2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}\right) \left(2^{\frac{4}{9}} e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}}\right) = \left(2^{\frac{4}{9}}\right)^4 = 2^{\frac{16}{9}}.
   \]

8. **Simplification:**

   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[
   2^{\frac{16}{9}} = (2^{\frac{4}{9}})^4 = (2^{\frac{4}{9}} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{9}} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{9}} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{9}}) = 2^{\frac{16}{9}} = 4.
   \]

Thus, the product of all possible values of $z_1$ is $-4$. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-4}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 74. Extracted: {
  "reasoning": "First, simplify the right side of the equation using trigonometric identities. We can rewrite the given expression as follows:\n\n\\[
\\frac{\\cos{96^{\circ}} + \\sin{96^{\circ}}}{\\cos{96^{\circ}} - \\sin{96^{\circ}}} = \\frac{1 + \\tan{96^{\circ}}}{1 - \\tan{96^{\circ}}} = \\tan{(96^{\circ} + 45^{\circ})} = \\tan{141^{\circ}}
\\]\n\nThis is due to the tangent addition formula and the fact that \\(\\tan{(A + B)} = \\frac{\\tan{A} + \\tan{B}}{1 - \\tan{A}\\tan{B}}\\) with \\(A = 96^{\circ}\\) and \\(B = 45^{\circ}\\). Thus, we have \\(\\tan{19x^{\circ}} = \\tan{141^{\circ}}\\).\n\nSince the tangent function has a period of \\(180^{\circ}\\), we can write \\(19x^{\circ} = 141^{\circ} + 180^{\circ}k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). To find the smallest positive integer solution for \\(x\\), we need to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[
19x = 141 + 180k
\\]\n\nWe seek the smallest positive \\(x\\), which means finding the smallest non-negative \\(k\\) such that \\(x\\) is a positive integer. By trial, when \\(k = -1\\), we get \\(19x = 141 - 180 = -39\\), which is not positive. When \\(k = 0\\), \\(19x = 141\\), so \\(x = \\frac{141}{19} = 7.421\\), which is not an integer. When \\(k = 1\\), \\(19x = 141 + 180 = 321\\), so \\(x = \\frac{321}{19} = 16.895\\), which is also not an integer. Finally, when \\(k = -2\\), \\(19x = 141 - 360 = -219\\), which is not positive.\n\nThe correct choice is \\(k = 2\\), where \\(19x = 141 + 360 = 501\\), giving us \\(x = \\frac{501}{19} = 26.368\\), but this is not an integer either. However, for \\(k = -1\\), we see that \\(k = 2\\) gives us the smallest positive integer solution for \\(x\\): \\(x = 26\\). Therefore, the smallest positive integer solution is \\(x = 26\\).",

  "reasoning": "To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \\(\\binom{10^9}{k}\\) is less than \\(\\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\\), we start by writing out the binomial coefficients explicitly and comparing them.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\) is given by \\(\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[
\\binom{10^9}{k} = \\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!}
\\]\nand\n\\[
\\binom{10^9 + 1}{k-1} = \\frac{(10^9+1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9+2-k)!}.
\\]\nWe need to find when \\(\\binom{10^9}{k} < \\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\\). Using the definition of binomial coefficients, this inequality can be written as:\n\\[
\\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!} < \\frac{(10^9+1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9+2-k)!}.
\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[
\\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!} < \\frac{(10^9+1)(10^9)!}{(k-1)!(10^9+2-k)(10^9-k)!}.
\\]\nCancelling common terms, we obtain:\n\\[
\\frac{1}{k} < \\frac{10^9+1}{(k-1)(10^9+2-k)}.
\\]\nRearranging gives us:\n\\[
(k-1)(10^9+2-k) < k(10^9+1).
\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[
10^9k + 2k - k^2 - 10^9 - 2 + k < 10^9k + k,
\\]\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\\[
2k - k^2 - 10^9 - 2 < 0,
\\]\nor\n\\[
k^2 - 2k + 10^9 + 2 > 0.
\\]\nThis quadratic inequality can be solved by finding its roots using the quadratic formula \\(k = \\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) with \\(a=1\\), \\(b=-2\\), and \\(c=10^9 + 2\\):\n\\[
k = \\frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(10^9 + 2)}}{2} = \\frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4(10^9)}}{2} = \\frac{2 \pm 2i\sqrt{10^9}}{2} = 1 \pm i\sqrt{10^9}.
\\]\nSince we are dealing with real numbers, we approximate the solution by considering the inequality directly:\n\\[
k^2 - 2k + 10^9 + 2 > 0.
\\]\nTesting values around \\(k = 500000000\\), we find that \\(k = 500000001\\) satisfies the condition. Hence, the first two digits of \\(k\\) are 5 and 0, so \\(10a + b = 10*5 + 0 = 50\\).",
