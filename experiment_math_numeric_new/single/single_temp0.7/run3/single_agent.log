Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 8. Extracted: {"answer": 6.893}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the relationship between energy and wavelength**: We know that the energy \(E\) of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength \(\lambda\). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}
   \]
   Or equivalently,
   \[
   E = \frac{k}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(k\) is a constant.

2. **Given data**: 
   - Wavelength of red light (\(\lambda_{red}\)) = \(7 \times 10^{-7}\) meters.
   - Energy of the photon we're interested in is 2000 times the energy of a red light photon.

3. **Expressing the new wavelength**: Let \(\lambda_{new}\) be the wavelength of the photon with 2000 times the energy of the red light photon. Since the energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength, we have:
   \[
   \frac{E_{new}}{\lambda_{new}} = \frac{E_{red}}{\lambda_{red}}
   \]
   Given \(E_{new} = 2000 \times E_{red}\), substituting this into the equation gives:
   \[
   \frac{2000 \times E_{red}}{\lambda_{new}} = \frac{E_{red}}{\lambda_{red}}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2000}{\lambda_{new}} = \frac{1}{\lambda_{red}}
   \]
   Solving for \(\lambda_{new}\):
   \[
   \lambda_{new} = 2000 \times \lambda_{red}
   \]

4. **Substitute the given wavelength**:
   \[
   \lambda_{new} = 2000 \times 7 \times 10^{-7} = 14000 \times 10^{-7} = 1.4 \times 10^{-3} \text{ meters}
   \]

5. **Writing the result in scientific notation**: The wavelength is already in scientific notation form \(1.4 \times 10^{-3}\).

6. **Calculating \(a + b\)**:
   Here, \(a = 1.4\) and \(b = -3\).
   Therefore, \(a + b = 1.4 + (-3) = -1.6\).

However, the question asks for \(a + b\) as a decimal, and the correct interpretation should be \(a + b = 1.4 + (-3) = -1.6\), but since the problem context suggests a positive sum, the actual \(a + b\) in terms of the scientific notation components should be correctly interpreted as \(1.4 + (-3) = -1.6\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1.6}

  "reasoning": "To solve this system of equations using complex numbers, let's introduce a complex number \( z = a + bi \) where \( i \) is the imaginary unit. Then, we can rewrite the given equations in terms of \( z \\). The first equation becomes:\n\n\\[

\\text{Im}(z) + \\frac{6\\text{Re}(z) - 17\\text{Im}(z)}{|z|^2} = 0.\n\\]\nWe can combine these into a single complex equation by noting that the second equation implies that the imaginary part of the fraction must cancel out the imaginary part of \( b \\), and similarly for the real parts.

  "reasoning": "We start by examining the inequality given in the problem, which is $\\binom{10^9}{k} < \\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}$. Using the definition of binomial coefficients, we can write this as\n\\[
\\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9-k)!} < \\frac{(10^9+1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9-k+1)!}.
\\]\nThis simplifies to\n\\[
\\frac{1}{k} < \\frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 - k + 1},
\\]\nwhich further simplifies to\n\\[
10^9 - k + 1 < k(10^9 + 1).
\\]\nSolving for $k$, we get\n\\[
10^9 + 1 < k(10^9 + 2),
\\]\nand therefore\n\\[
k > \\frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 + 2}.
\\]\nApproximating the right-hand side, we find that $k > 1 - \\frac{1}{10^9 + 2}$, which means the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $k = 2$.\nThus, the first digit of $k$ is $2$ and the second digit is $0$, making $10a + b = 10*2 + 0 = 20$.",
