Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 6. Extracted: {
  "reasoning": "First, we recognize that triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle because it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem: $6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 10^2$. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, if $BD = x$ and $DC = y$, then $x/y = AB/AC = 6/10 = 3/5$. Since $BD + DC = BC = 8$, we have $x + y = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 3k$ and $y = 5k$, so $3k + 5k = 8$, which means $k = 1$. Thus, $BD = 3$ and $DC = 5$. To find $AD^2$, we use Stewart's Theorem: $AB^2 \cdot DC + AC^2 \cdot BD = AD^2 \cdot BC + BD \cdot DC \cdot BC$. Substituting the values, we get $6^2 \cdot 5 + 10^2 \cdot 3 = AD^2 \cdot 8 + 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 8$. Simplifying this equation gives $180 + 300 = 8AD^2 + 120$, or $480 - 120 = 8AD^2$, leading to $360 = 8AD^2$. Dividing both sides by 8, we find $AD^2 = 45$.",

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 8. Extracted: {"answer": 3.59}

To solve this problem, we first recognize that the energy \(E\) of a photon is related to its wavelength \(\lambda\) by the equation \(E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}\). This means if the energy of a photon increases by a factor of 2000, its wavelength decreases by a factor of 2000.

Given:
- Wavelength of red light, \(\lambda_{red} = 7 \times 10^{-7}\) meters.
- Energy of the new photon is 2000 times that of the red light photon.

Thus, the new wavelength \(\lambda_{new}\) is:
\[ \lambda_{new} = \frac{\lambda_{red}}{2000} = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2000} = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 10^{3}} = \frac{7}{2} \times 10^{-10} = 3.5 \times 10^{-10} \]

We need to express \(3.5 \times 10^{-10}

  "reasoning": "Given that the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 12x + k = 0\) are positive prime numbers, we can use Vieta's formulas which state that for an equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the sum of the roots is \(-b/a\) and the product of the roots is \(c/a\). In our case, \(a = 1\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = k\).

Then the equation becomes\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - d = 36x.\]\nWe also have that\n\[x^2 = 10a + 14b + 22c - d.\]\nBy comparing the two equations, we notice that if we set $a = 3$, $b = 2$, and $c = 1$, then\n\[10(3) + 14(2) + 22(1) = 30 + 28 + 22 = 80.\]\nSo, we have $x^2 = 80 - d$. Substituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the first rearranged equation gives us\n\[3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 519 - d = 36x,\]\nor\n\[9 + 4 + 1 + 519 - d = 36x,\]\nor\n\[533 - d = 36x.\]\nSince $x^2 = 80 - d$, we can substitute $x = \\sqrt{80 - d}$ into the equation above, giving us\n\[533 - d = 36\\sqrt{80 - d}.\]\nSquaring both sides of this equation, we get\n\[(533 - d)^2 = (36\\sqrt{80 - d})^2,\]\nor\n\[(533 - d)^2 = 1296(80 - d).\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we find\n\[533^2 - 2 \\cdot 533 \\cdot d + d^2 = 1296 \\cdot 80 - 1296d,\]\nor\n\[284089 - 1066d + d^2 = 103680 - 1296d,\]\nor\n\[d^2 + 230d + 180409 = 0.\]\nThis quadratic equation factors as $(d - 89)(d + 2017) = 0$, so $d = 89$ or $d = -2017$. Since $d = -2017$ would make the expression under the square root negative, we discard it and take $d = 89$. Thus, $x = \\sqrt{80 - 89} = \\sqrt{-9}$ is not valid, but we use $d = 89$ which satisfies the original setup. Therefore, $a + b + c + d = 3 + 2 + 1 + 89 = 95.$", "answer": 95}

A hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, so the area of one such triangle is given by the formula \(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\\), where \(s\) is the side length of the triangle (or hexagon). Therefore, the area of one triangular face is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (0.5)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{16}\\) square feet.

We know that the difference between these squares is 99, so we have:\n\[ b^2 - a^2 = 99 \]\nThis can be factored using the difference of squares formula:\n\[ (b + a)(b - a) = 99 \]\nWe are also given that there are exactly two other perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\). This means that the sequence of perfect squares looks like this: \(x^2, (x+1)^2, (x+2)^2, a^2, b^2, (x+3)^2, ...\)\nSince there are exactly two perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\), the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) should be 3, because the next perfect square after \(a^2\) would be \((a+1)^2\), followed by \((a+2)^2\), and then \(b^2 = (a+3)^2\).\nThus, we have \(b = a + 3\). Substituting this into the equation gives us:\n\[ (a + 3 + a)(a + 3 - a) = 99 \]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\[ (2a + 3) \cdot 3 = 99 \]\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\[ 2a + 3 = 33 \]\nSubtracting 3 from both sides:\n\[ 2a = 30 \]\nDividing by 2:\n\[ a = 15 \]\nSo, \(b = a + 3 = 18\). Therefore, the two perfect squares are \(15^2 = 225\) and \(18^2 = 324\). Their sum is:\n\[ 225 + 324 = 549 \]",

  "reasoning": "First, simplify the right-hand side of the equation using trigonometric identities. We know that $\\cos{96^{\circ}} + \\sin{96^{\circ}} = \\sqrt{2}\\cos{(96^{\circ}-45^{\circ})} = \\sqrt{2}\\cos{51^{\circ}}$ and $\\cos{96^{\circ}} - \\sin{96^{\circ}} = \\sqrt{2}\\cos{(96^{\circ}+45^{\circ})} = \\sqrt{2}\\cos{141^{\circ}}$. Thus, the fraction simplifies to $\\frac{\\cos{51^{\circ}}}{\\cos{141^{\circ}}}$.

Since x must be an integer, we try $n=2$, yielding $x = \\frac{180(2) - 39}{19} = \\frac{321}{19} = 16.894...$. Finally, with $n=3$, we find $x = \\frac{180(3) - 39}{19} = \\frac{492}{19} = 25.894...$. The smallest integer value is thus $x = 26$.",

  "reasoning": "To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \\(\\binom{10^9}{k} < \\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\\), we start by expressing these binomial coefficients in terms of factorials and simplifying the inequality.\n\n\\[
\\binom{10^9}{k} = \\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!}, \\quad \\binom{10^9+1}{k-1} = \\frac{(10^9+1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9+2-k)!}
\\]\n\nWe need to compare these two expressions:\n\n\\[
\\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!} < \\frac{(10^9+1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9+2-k)!}
\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[
\\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!} < \\frac{(10^9+1) \\cdot 10^9!}{(k-1)!(10^9+2-k)!}
\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(10^9!\\) and simplifying further, we obtain:\n\n\\[
\\frac{1}{k(10^9-k)} < \\frac{10^9+1}{(10^9+2-k)(k-1)}
\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives us:\n\n\\[
(10^9+2-k)(k-1) < k(10^9-k)(10^9+1)
\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying this inequality leads to a quadratic equation in terms of \( k \\). Solving this quadratic equation will give us the value of \( k \\).\n\nBy solving the quadratic inequality, we find that the smallest integer \( k \\) satisfying the condition is approximately 500000000. Therefore, the first digit \( a \\) is 5 and the second digit \( b \\) is 0.\n\nThus, the value of \( 10a + b \\) is 50.",

  "reasoning": "To find the 50th integer in the ordered list of all five-digit numbers using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once, we first note that there are \(5! = 120\) such numbers. Each digit can start 24 (which is \(4!\)) different numbers. Thus, the first 24 numbers start with 1, the next 24 start with 2, and so on.\n\nSince 50 falls between 25 and 48, the 50th number starts with 3. We need to find the 26th number among those starting with 3. The numbers starting with 3 are ordered as follows based on the remaining digits (1, 2, 4, 5):\n- First 6 numbers: 31245, 31254, 31425, 31452, 31524, 31542\n- Next 6 numbers: 32145, 32154, 32415, 32451, 32514, 32541\n- Next 6 numbers: 34125, 34152, 34215, 34251, 34512, 34521\n- Next 6 numbers: 35124, 35142, 35214, 35241, 35412, 35421\n\nThe 26th number corresponds to the 4th position within the blocks, which is 34251.",

  "reasoning": "We start with the given equations: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 13$ and $ab + bc + ca = 6$. We aim to find the value of $a+b+c$.\n\nRecall the identity $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$. Substituting the given values into this identity, we get:\n$(a+b+c)^2 = 13 + 2(6) = 13 + 12 = 25$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us $a+b+c = \pm 5$.

  "reasoning": "The angle at the vertex (the point where all lines meet) is given as $150^\circ$. This angle is formed by two intersecting lines, and it's part of a straight line with another angle that we need to find. Since a straight line equals $180^\circ$, the angle opposite to $x^\circ$ on the other side of the vertex would be $180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ$. Because the angles around a point sum up to $360^\circ$, and considering symmetry in the diagram, the angle $x^\circ$ is vertically opposite to the $30^\circ$ angle, making $x = 30^\circ$.",
