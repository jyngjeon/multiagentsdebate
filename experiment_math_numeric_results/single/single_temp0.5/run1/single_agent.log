Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 3. Extracted: {"reasoning": "To find the base \( b \\) in which the given addition problem is correct, we need to convert each number from base \( b \\) to base 10 and then perform the addition in base 10. We will then compare the result with the sum provided in base \( b \\).\n\nFirst, convert each number from base \( b \\) to base 10:\n- \( 6651_b = 6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1 \\)\n- \( 115_b = 1b^2 + 1b + 5 \\)\n- \( 10066_b = 1b^4 + 0b^3 + 0b^2 + 6b + 6 \\)\n\nNext, add the first two numbers in base 10:\n\[ (6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1) + (1b^2 + 1b + 5) = 6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 \\]\n\nThis sum should equal the third number in base 10:\n\[ 6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 = b^4 + 6b + 6 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation by subtracting \( 6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 \\) from both sides:\n\[ 0 = b^4 - 6b^3 - 7b^2 \\]\n\nFactor out the common term \( b^2 \\):\n\[ b^2(b^2 - 6b - 7) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\[ b^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \\]\n\nSince \( b > 6 \\), we discard \( b^2 = 0 \\). Solve the quadratic equation \( b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula \( b = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \\):\n\[ b = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 28}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 8}{2} \\]\n\nThus, \( b = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) or \( b = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1 \\).

  "reasoning": "To find \( AD^2 \) in the given triangle \( \\triangle ABC \), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem and Stewart's Theorem.\n\nFirst, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, if \( D \) is on \( BC \), then:\n\[ \\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}. \\]\nLet \( BD = 3x \\) and \( DC = 5x \\).

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {"answer": -4}

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions on the sequence \((z_n)\) of complex numbers.

Firstly, let's consider the recurrence relation \(z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n\). This means that each term in the sequence is defined based on the previous two terms. Given that \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) are not real, we can express them as \(z_1 = a + bi\) and \(z_2 = c + di\) where \(b \neq 0\) and \(d \neq 0\).

Next, we use the condition that \(\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}\) is real for all \(n \geq 1\). Let's compute \(z_3\) and \(z_4\) using the recurrence relation:
\[ z_3 = z_2^2 z_1 \]
\[ z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^4 z_1^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2 \]

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \]

Let's calculate \(\left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right|\):
\[ \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^3 z_1} \right| = \frac{1}{|z_2|^3 |z_1|} \]

Given that \(\left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = 2\), we have:
\[ \frac{1}{|z_2|^3 |z_1|} = 2 \implies |z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2} \]

Similarly, for \(\left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right|\):
\[ z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{10} z_1^4 z_2^2 z_1 = z_2^{12} z_1^5 \]
\[ \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^{12} z_1^5} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^3} \right| = \frac{1}{|z_2|^7 |z_1|^3} \]

Given that \(\left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2\), we have:
\[ \frac{1}{|z_2|^7 |z_1|^3} = 2 \implies |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we have two equations:
\[ |z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]

Dividing these two equations:
\[ \frac{|z_2|^7 |z_1|^3}{|z_2|^3 |z_1|} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} \implies |z_2|^4 |z_1|^2 = 1 \]

Thus:
\[ |z_2|^4 |z_1|^2 = 1 \implies (|z_2|^2 |z_1|)^2 = 1 \implies |z_2|^2 |z_1| = 1 \text{ or } |z_2|^2 |z_1| = -1 \]

Since magnitudes are non-negative, we have:
\[ |z_2|^2 |z_1| = 1 \]

Substituting back into \(|z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[ |z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2} \implies |z_2| \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2} \implies |z_2| = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ |z_1| = 2 \]

The magnitude of \(z_1\) is 2, so \(z_1\) could be \(2e^{i\theta}\) for some angle \(\theta\). Since \(z_1\) is not real, \(\theta\) cannot be 0 or \(\pi\). Therefore, the possible values for \(z_1\) are \(2e^{i\theta}\) and \(2e^{-i\theta}\).

The product of all possible values of \(z_1\) is:
\[ 2e^{i\theta} \cdot 2e^{-i\theta} = 4 \]

However, considering the symmetry and the fact that both values contribute equally, the product of all possible values of \(z_1\) is:
\[ -4 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{-4}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 32. Extracted: {"reasoning": "We start by rearranging the given equation to isolate the square root term on one side:\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - d = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}.\]\nLet's denote the left-hand side as $LHS$ and the right-hand side as $RHS$. We notice that both sides of the equation are non-negative, which implies that the expression under the square root is non-negative. To simplify this equation, we can try to express the left-hand side in a form that matches the right-hand side more closely. Consider the following manipulation:\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - d = (6\\sqrt{10})^2 + (6\\sqrt{14})^2 + (6\\sqrt{22})^2 - (6)^2 = 36(10 + 14 + 22 - 1) = 36\\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}^2.\]\nThis suggests that the terms inside the square root should match the squares of the coefficients outside the square root. Therefore, we can equate the expressions inside the square roots and solve for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$:\n\[10a + 14b + 22c - d = (6\\sqrt{10})^2 + (6\\sqrt{14})^2 + (6\\sqrt{22})^2 - (6)^2 = 36(10 + 14 + 22 - 1) = 36\\cdot 45 = 1620.\]\nThus, we have\n\[10a + 14b + 22c - d = 1620.\]\nFrom the original equation, we also know that\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - d = 36\\sqrt{1620} = 36\\cdot 6\\sqrt{15} = 216\\sqrt{15}.\]\nHowever, since the left-hand side must be a perfect square (as it equals the square of the right-hand side), and considering the structure of the equation, we can deduce that $a = 6\\sqrt{10}$, $b = 6\\sqrt{14}$, $c = 6\\sqrt{22}$, and $d = 1620 - (10a + 14b + 22c)$ simplifies to $d = 1620 - 1620 = 0$. Thus, the sum $a + b + c + d$ is\n\[6\\sqrt{10} + 6\\sqrt{14} + 6\\sqrt{22} + 0 = 6(\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{14} + \\sqrt{22}).\]\nGiven the specific values and the structure of the equation, we find that $a = 6$, $b = 6$, $c = 6$, and $d = 1620 - 1620 = 0$. Hence, the sum is $6 + 6 + 6 + 0 = 18.$", "answer": 18}

  "reasoning": "Let's denote the smaller perfect square as \(a^2\) and the larger one as \(b^2\), where \(b > a\). We know that the difference between these two perfect squares is 99, so we have the equation:\n\[b^2 - a^2 = 99\]\nThis can be factored using the difference of squares formula:\[(b + a)(b - a) = 99\]\nWe are also told that there are exactly two other perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\). This means that the gap between consecutive perfect squares (which increases as the numbers get larger) should allow for exactly two such squares to fit in the interval from \(a^2\) to \(b^2\).\n\nConsidering the factor pairs of 99, we look for pairs \((b+a, b-a)\) that would give us integer solutions for \(b\) and \(a\). Since there are exactly two perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\), the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) should be large enough but not too large.\n\nThe factor pair that fits this condition is (11, 9), because it gives us the smallest possible \(b\) and \(a\) that satisfy the conditions. Solving the system of equations:\[b + a = 11\]\[b - a = 9\]\nAdding these equations gives:\[2b = 20 \Rightarrow b = 10\]\nSubtracting the second from the first gives:\[2a = 2 \Rightarrow a = 1\]\nSo, the two perfect squares are \(1^2 = 1\) and \(10^2 = 100\). Checking, the difference is indeed 99 and there are exactly two perfect squares (4 and 9) between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two perfect squares on the blackboard is:\[1 + 100 = 101\]",

We have four terms in \(S\\) which can be expanded using the formula \\((a+b+c+d)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd)\\). However, since we are adding four such expressions, we can simplify our work by recognizing that each squared term will appear four times (once in each square), and each product term will appear twice (since each pair of terms appears in two different squares).\n\nFirst, let's expand each square individually:\n1. \\((-\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{7})^2 = (-\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2 + (\\sqrt{7})^2 + 2(-\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{6}\\sqrt{7})\\)\n2. \\((\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{7})^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (-\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2 + (\\sqrt{7})^2 + 2(\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{6}\\sqrt{7})\\)\n3. \\((\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{7})^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (-\\sqrt{6})^2 + (\\sqrt{7})^2 + 2(\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{6}\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{7})\\)\n4. \\((\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{7})^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2 + (-\\sqrt{7})^2 + 2(\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{6}\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{6})\\)\n\nWhen we add these together, all the cross-product terms cancel out because each product term appears exactly twice with opposite signs. Therefore, we are left with four times the sum of the squares of the individual terms:\\[4[(\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2 + (\\sqrt{7})^2]\\]\nCalculating this gives us:\\[4[3 + 5 + 6 + 7] = 4[21] = 84\\]",

\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}.
\\]\nSince $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors and $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, it follows that $A=4$, $B=2$, and $C=3$. Therefore, $A+B+C = 4+2+3 = 9.$",

  "reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means to write numbers in different bases. Let's start by converting the given expressions from their respective bases into base 10.\n\nFirstly, $121_c$ in base $c$ can be expressed as $1 \\cdot c^2 + 2 \\cdot c + 1 = b^2$. This simplifies to $b^2 = c^2 + 2c + 1$.\n\nSecondly, $71_b$ in base $b$ can be expressed as $7 \\cdot b + 1 = c^2$. This simplifies to $c^2 = 7b + 1$.\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1. $b^2 = c^2 + 2c + 1$\n2. $c^2 = 7b + 1$\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives us $b^2 = (7b + 1) + 2\\sqrt{7b + 1} + 1$. However, since $c^2$ is already simplified to $7b + 1$, we can directly substitute and simplify without needing to take square roots explicitly.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express $c^2$ as $7b + 1$. Substituting this into the first equation gives us $b^2 = 7b + 1 + 2c + 1$. Since $c^2 = 7b + 1$, we know that $c = \sqrt{7b + 1}$, which implies $c$ must be an integer. Testing small values of $b$ to find an integer solution for $c$ leads us to $b=8$ and $c=9$ as the smallest positive integers satisfying both conditions.\n\nTherefore, $b+c = 8+9 = 17$.",

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 96. Extracted: {"reasoning": "The angle marked as $150^\circ$ is an exterior angle to the triangle formed by the lines. In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is $180^\circ$. The exterior angle equals the sum of the two opposite interior angles. Since one of the interior angles of the triangle at the vertex where the lines meet is a right angle ($90^\circ$) due to the perpendicular intersection, the other interior angle (which is supplementary to $x$) must be $180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ$. Therefore, $x$ is the remaining angle in the right angle, making $x = 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ$.", "answer": 60}
