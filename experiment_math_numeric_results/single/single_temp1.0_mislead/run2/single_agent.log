Convert each term from base \( b \) to base 10:

1. The first number \( 6651_b \):
\[
6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1
\]

2. The second number \( 115_b \):
\[
b^2 + b + 5
\]

3. The sum \( 10066_b \):
\[
b^4 + b^2 + 6b + 6
\]

The equation we need to satisfy is:
\[
(6b^3 + 6b^2 + 5b + 1) + (b^2 + b + 5) = b^4 + b^2 + 6b + 6
\]

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[
6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6
\]

Equate this to the right side:
\[
6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 = b^4 + b^2 + 6b + 6
\]

Subtract \( 6b^3 + 7b^2 + 6b + 6 \) from both sides:
\[
0 = b^4 - 6b^3 - 6b^2
\]

Factor out \( b^2 \):
\[
b^2(b^2 - 6b - 6) = 0
\]

This gives us two equations:
1. \( b^2 = 0 \)
2. \( b^2 - 6b - 6 = 0 \)

Since \( b \neq 0 \), we focus on solving:
\[
b^2 - 6b - 6 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \), where \( A = 1 \), \( B = -6 \), and \( C = -6 \):
\[
b = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-6)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 24}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{60}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 2\sqrt{15}}{2} = 3 \pm \sqrt{15}
\]

Since \( b \) must be an integer, we test possible integer values. Testing \( b = 3 + \sqrt{15} \approx 6.87 \) and \( b = 3 - \sqrt{15} \approx -0.87 \) shows that only \( b = 7 \) fits within typical numerical bases.

Testing \( b = 7 \):
\[
6(7^3) + 6(7^2) + 5(7) + 1 + (7^2 + 7 + 5) = 7^4 + 7^2 + 6(7) + 6
\]
\[
6(343) + 6(49) + 35 + 1 + 49 + 7 + 5 = 2401 + 49 + 42 + 6
\]
\[
2058 + 92 = 2150
\]
\[
2150 = 2150
\]

Thus, \( b = 7 \).

Therefore, the value of the base \( b \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 11. Extracted: {5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the areas involved:
- Area of the larger circle (radius 2): \( A_{\text{large}} = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi \)
- Area of the smaller circle (radius 1): \( A_{\text{small}} = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi \)

Given that the shaded area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[ \text{Shaded area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]

The shaded area includes parts of both circles. Specifically, it consists of:
- Sector of the larger circle with radius 2
- Sector of the smaller circle with radius 1

Let \(\theta\) be the central angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. 

The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[ A_{\text{sector, large}} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta \]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[ A_{\text{sector, small}} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2} \]

Thus, the total shaded area can be expressed as:
\[ 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[ 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta - \theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2} \]

So we have:
\[ \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]

Solving for \(\theta\):
\[ 3\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3} \]
\[ \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \]

Converting \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:
\[ \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180^\circ}{9} = \frac{1800^\circ}{9} = 200^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[ \boxed{200}

Thus, solving for \( AB \):
\[ AB = 40 \text{ cm} - 20 \text{ cm} = 20 \text{ cm} \]

We also know:
\[ AD = AB + BD \]
\[ 30 \text{ cm} = AB + BD \]
Since \( AB = 20 \text{ cm} \),
\[ 30 \text{ cm} = 20 \text{ cm} + BD \]
Solving for \( BD \):
\[ BD = 30 \text{ cm} - 20 \text{ cm} = 10 \text{ cm} \]

\( C \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{BD} \). Therefore, the distance from \( B \) to \( C \) is half of \( BD \):
\[ BC = \frac{BD}{2} = \frac{10 \text{ cm}}{2} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Now, we need to find the distance \( AC \):
\[ AC = AB + BC \]
\[ AC = 20 \text{ cm} + 5 \text{ cm} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n \]

We also know that:
\[ \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} \]
is real for all integers \( n \geq 1 \), and
\[ \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \]

From the recurrence relation, we have:
\[ z_3 = z_2^2 z_1 \]
\[ z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2 \]
\[ z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{12} z_1^5 \]

Using the given condition:
\[ \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \]

Substitute the expressions for \( z_3, z_4, z_5 \):
\[ \left| \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^{12} z_1^5} \right| \]
Simplify these:
\[ \left| \frac{1}{z_2^3 z_1} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^3} \right| \]
Thus,
\[ \left| \frac{1}{z_2^3 z_1} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^3} \right| \]
This implies:
\[ |z_2^4| = |z_1^2| \]

Since \( \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = 2 \):
\[ \left| \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2} \right| = 2 \]
\[ \left| \frac{1}{z_2^3 z_1} \right| = 2 \]
Thus:
\[ \frac{1}{|z_2|^3 |z_1|} = 2 \]
So,
\[ |z_2|^3 |z_1| = \frac{1}{2} \]

From \( |z_2^4| = |z_1^2| \):
\[ |z_2|^4 = |z_1|^2 \]
Let \( |z_2| = r \) and \( |z_1| = s \). Then:
\[ r^4 = s^2 \]
\[ r^3 s = \frac{1}{2} \]

Solve these equations:
\[ r^4 = s^2 \implies s = r^2 \]
Substitute into the second equation:
\[ r^3 r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ r^5 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ r = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{1}{5}} \]
Then:
\[ s = r^2 = \left( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{1}{5}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{2}{5}} \]

The magnitude of \( z_1 \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{2}{5}} \). Since \( z_1 \) is not real, it can be written as \( z_1 = re^{i\theta} \). Given \( |z_1| = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{2}{5}} \), the possible values of \( z_1 \) lie on a circle in the complex plane with radius \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{2}{5}} \).

Since \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) are not real, they can take any phase angle. Therefore, the product of all possible values of \( z_1 \) will be:
\[ \left( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{2}{5}} e^{i\theta} \right) \cdot \left( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{2}{5}} e^{-i\theta} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Thus, the product of all possible values of \( z_1 \) is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 29. Extracted: {17a + 6b}{a^2 + b^2} = 6,
\]
\[
b + \frac{6a - 17b}{a^2 + b^2} = 0,
\]
we will use the hint and employ complex numbers.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Rewrite in terms of a complex variable:**
   Let \( z = a + bi \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers and \( i \) is the imaginary unit (\(i^2 = -1\)). 

2. **Express the equations in terms of \(z\):**
   We can rewrite the given system as:
   \[
   \text{Re}(z) + \frac{\text{Re}((17+6i)z)}{|z|^2} = 6,
   \]
   \[
   \text{Im}(z) + \frac{\text{Im}((17-6i)z)}{|z|^2} = 0.
   \]

3. **Simplify using properties of complex numbers:**
   Since \( z = a + bi \),
   \[
   (17 + 6i)(a + bi) = (17a - 6b) + (6a + 17b)i,
   \]
   and 
   \[
   |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2.
   \]

4. **Substitute back into the original equations:**
   The first equation becomes:
   \[
   a + \frac{17a - 6b}{a^2 + b^2} = 6,
   \]
   and the second equation becomes:
   \[
   b + \frac{6a + 17b}{a^2 + b^2} = 0.
   \]

5. **Combine these into a single equation involving \(z\):**
   Consider \( f(z) = z + \frac{(17 + 6i)z}{|z|^2} \). Then we have:
   \[
   f(z) = z + \frac{17z + 6iz}{a^2 + b^2} = z + \frac{17z + 6iz}{|z|^2}.
   \]
   We can simplify it as:
   \[
   f(z) = z + \frac{(17 + 6i)z}{|z|^2}.
   \]
   Using the given equations, we get:
   \[
   \text{Re}(f(z)) = 6,
   \]
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(z)) = 0.
   \]
   Therefore, \( f(z) = 6 \).

6. **Analyze the solutions:**
   Let \( z = re^{i\theta} \), then:
   \[
   z + \frac{(17 + 6i)re^{i\theta}}{r^2} = 6.
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   re^{i\theta} + \frac{(17 + 6i)e^{i\theta}}{r} = 6.
   \]
   This gives:
   \[
   r + \frac{17 + 6i}{r} = 6e^{-i\theta}.
   \]
   Taking magnitudes and solving, we find:
   \[
   r + \frac{17 + 6i}{r} = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r^2 - 6r + 17 + 6i = 0.
   \]
   Solving for \(r\) yields two roots.

7. **Sum of all solutions:**
   If we have pairs \((a_i, b_i)\) that satisfy these equations, summing them up:
   By symmetry and complex conjugate properties, the sum of all real parts and imaginary parts will cancel out except at fixed points.

Therefore, the sum \( a_1 + b_1 + a_2 + b_2 + \dots + a_n + b_n \) is zero.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Now compute the expression in base 10:

\[ 16_{10} + 71_{10} - 45_{10} - 67_{10} = (16 + 71) - (45 + 67) = 87 - 112 = -25_{10} \]

Since we have a negative result, we'll need to convert -25 back to base 3. To do that, we first find the positive representation of 25 in base 3:

\[ 25_{10} = 2 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0 = 212_3 \]

Therefore, -25 in base 3 is simply written as the negative of this number, but since we're working with base 3 notation, it would be expressed as a complement form or simply denoted with a minus sign before the number:

\[-25_{10} = -212_3 \]

Thus, the final answer in base 3 is:

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 55. Extracted: {pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, compute the left-hand side of the equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

This gives us the matrix equality:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

By comparing corresponding elements, we get four equations:

1. \(a^2 + bc = c\)
2. \(ab + bd = a\)
3. \(ac + dc = d\)
4. \(bc + d^2 = b\)

Let's analyze these equations one by one:

### Equation 1: \(a^2 + bc = c\)
Rewriting this, we get:
\[ a^2 + bc - c = 0 \implies a^2 + (b-1)c = 0 \implies c(a^2 + b - 1) = 0. \]
Thus, either \(c = 0\) or \(a^2 + b - 1 = 0\).

### Equation 2: \(ab + bd = a\)
Factor out \(b\):
\[ ab + bd = a \implies b(a + d) = a. \]
If \(b \neq 0\), then:
\[ a + d = \frac{a}{b}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ ab + bd = a \implies b(a + d) = a \implies b(a + d) = a \implies b(a + d - \frac{a}{b}) = 0. \]
If \(b = 0\), then:
\[ a + d = 0 \implies d = -a. \]

### Equation 3: \(ac + dc = d\)
Factor out \(c\):
\[ ac + dc = d \implies c(a + d) = d. \]
If \(c \neq 0\), then:
\[ a + d = \frac{d}{c}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c(a + d) = d \implies c(a + d - \frac{d}{c}) = 0. \]
If \(c = 0\), then:
\[ d = 0. \]

### Equation 4: \(bc + d^2 = b\)
Rewriting this, we get:
\[ bc + d^2 = b \implies d^2 + bc - b = 0 \implies d^2 + b(c - 1) = 0. \]
Thus, either \(d = 0\) or \(b(c - 1) = -d^2\).

Now, let's combine our findings:

- If \(c = 0\):
  - From Equation 1: \(a^2 + bc = 0 \implies a^2 = 0 \implies a = 0\).
  - From Equation 3: \(d = 0\).
  - From Equation 4: \(b \cdot 0 - b = 0 \implies b = 0\).

So, one solution is \((a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 0, 0)\).

- If \(d = 0\):
  - From Equation 2: \(a + 0 = \frac{a}{b} \implies a(1 - \frac{1}{b}) = 0 \implies a = 0\) or \(b = 1\).
  - From Equation 3: \(ac + 0 = 0 \implies ac = 0 \implies c = 0\) or \(a = 0\).
  - From Equation 4: \(bc = b \implies b(c - 1) = 0 \implies b = 0\) or \(c = 1\).

So, solutions are \((a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, c, 0)\) and \((a, b, c, d) = (a, 1, 1, 0)\).

For \(a^2 + b - 1 = 0\) and \(a + d = \frac{a}{b}\):

- Solving \(a^2 + b - 1 = 0\) for \(b\): \(b = 1 - a^2\).
- Then, \(d = \frac{a}{b} - a = \frac{a}{1 - a^2} - a\).

We conclude there are no additional valid solutions from this case.

Combining all cases, the solutions are \((0, 0, 0, 0)\), \((0, 0, c, 0)\), and \((a, 1, 1, 0)\).

Hence, the total number of solutions is infinite, but distinct ordered quadruples are:

\(\boxed{3}

  "reasoning": "Given the problem, we can use the properties of perfect squares and the difference between them. Let's denote the smaller square as \(a^2\) and the larger square as \(b^2\). We know that the difference between these two squares is 99, i.e., \(b^2 - a^2 = 99\). Also, there are exactly two other perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\). This implies that \(b^2 - a^2\) is greater than or equal to 3 more consecutive squares minus the first and last, which gives us a range of 15 when considering three gaps (since each gap between perfect squares increases progressively). However, since it specifically mentions two perfect squares between them, we consider the smallest possible scenario which is \(16 + 15 + 16 = 47\), but here it is 99, fitting perfectly with \(b^2 - a^2 = 99 = 10^2 - 1^2 + 8*11\) (considering \(1^2, 4^2, 9^2\) in between 1 and 10).\n\nThus, solving \(b^2 - a^2 = 99\) gives us \((b+a)(b-a) = 99\). Factoring 99 into two factors that are both even or both odd (as \(b+a\) and \(b-a\) are both integers), the most suitable pair here is \(11 \times 9\), giving us \(b+a = 11\) and \(b-a = 9\). Solving these simultaneous equations gives \(b = 10\) and \(a = 1\). Therefore, the squares are \(1^2 = 1\) and \(10^2 = 100\). Their sum is \(1 + 100 = 101\).",

1. Reflect the point $A(3,3)$ across the x-axis.
   - When a point $(x,y)$ is reflected across the x-axis, its y-coordinate changes sign, so the reflection of $A(3,3)$ is $A'(3,-3)$.

2. Translate $A'$ two units to the left.
   - To translate a point $(x,y)$ two units to the left, we subtract 2 from the x-coordinate, so the new point is $A''(3-2,-3)=(1,-3)$.

Thus, the coordinates of $A^{''}$ are $(1,-3)$.

Finally, the sum of the coordinates $x+y$ for point $A^{''}$ is $1 + (-3) = -2$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 75. Extracted: {\tan x}{\sec x + 1} - \frac{\sec x - 1}{\tan x}\), we can start by expressing \(\tan x\) and \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\):

\[
\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}, \quad \sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}.
\]

Substituting these into the original expression:

\[
\frac{\tan x}{\sec x + 1} - \frac{\sec x - 1}{\tan x} = \frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1}{\cos x} + 1} - \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x} - 1}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}.
\]

Simplifying each term individually:

1. Simplify \(\frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1}{\cos x} + 1}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1}{\cos x} + 1} = \frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1 + \cos x}{\cos x}} = \frac{\sin x}{1 + \cos x}.
\]

2. Simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x} - 1}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x} - 1}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}} = \frac{\frac{1 - \cos x}{\cos x}}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}} = \frac{1 - \cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Now the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{1 + \cos x} - \frac{1 - \cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

We find a common denominator for the two fractions, which is \((1 + \cos x) \sin x\):

\[
\frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x - (1 - \cos x)(1 + \cos x)}{(1 + \cos x) \sin x}.
\]

Expanding and simplifying the numerator:

\[
\sin^2 x - (1 - \cos^2 x).
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1 \implies \sin^2 x = 1 - \cos^2 x.
\]

Thus:
\[
\sin^2 x - (1 - \cos^2 x) = \sin^2 x - 1 + \cos^2 x = \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{0}{(1 + \cos x) \sin x} = 0.
\]

Thus, the simplified answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 87. Extracted: {10^9}{k}\) is less than the binomial coefficient \(\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\).

First, recall the definition of binomial coefficients:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Given the condition:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}
\]

We can express these binomial coefficients as follows:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} = \frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!}
\]
\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Rewriting the inequality:
\[
\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Simplify \((10^9 + 1)!\):
\[
(10^9 + 1)! = (10^9 + 1) \cdot 10^9!
\]

Substituting back:
\[
\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1) \cdot 10^9!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Cancel \(10^9!\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1)}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Simplify further:
\[
\frac{1}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)}
\]

Rewrite \(k!\) and \((k-1)!\):
\[
\frac{1}{k(k-1)!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)}
\]

Cancel \((k-1)!\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{k(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)}
\]

Multiply both sides by \(k(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k)\):
\[
(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k) < k(10^9 + 1)
\]

Expand the left-hand side:
\[
(10^9 + 2 - k)(10^9 + 1 - k) = 10^{18} + 3 \cdot 10^9 + 2 - 2 \cdot 10^9 - 3k + k^2 = 10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2
\]

So we have:
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < k(10^9 + 1)
\]

Rearrange terms:
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 - 3k + k^2 < 10^9 k + k
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
10^{18} + 10^9 + 2 < k^2 + 10^9 k + 4k
\]

Approximate by ignoring lower-order terms:
\[
10^{18} \approx k^2
\]

Thus,
\[
k \approx \sqrt{10^{18}} = 10^9
\]

Check \(k = 500000000\) and \(k = 500000001\):
For \(k = 500000000\):
\[
k^2 + 10^9 k + 4k \approx 10^{18} + 10^9 \cdot 10^9 + 4 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} + 10^{18} + 4 \cdot 10^9 > 10^{18} + 10^9 + 2
\]

For \(k = 500000001\):
\[
k^2 + 10^9 k + 4k \approx 10^{18} + 10^9 \cdot 10^9 + 4 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} + 10^{18} + 4 \cdot 10^9 > 10^{18} + 10^9 + 2
\]

Thus, \(k = 500000001\) is the smallest value satisfying the inequality.

Finally, \(a = 5\) and \(b = 0\), so:
\[
10a + b = 10 \times 5 + 0 = 50
\]

The final answer is:
\[
