Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 3. Extracted: {or} \quad -b^2 + 6b + 7 = 0 \]

Since \( b \neq 0 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -b^2 + 6b + 7 = 0 \]
\[ b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \]

We factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ (b - 7)(b + 1) = 0 \]

So, \( b = 7 \) or \( b = -1 \). Since \( b \) must be a positive integer greater than the digits used (i.e., \( b > 6 \)), we have:
\[ b = 7 \]

Thus, the value of the base \( b \) is:

\[

  "reasoning": "First, we use the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that if $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, $BD/DC = AB/AC$. In our case, $BD/DC = 6/10 = 3/5$. Let $BD = 3x$ and $DC = 5x$. Since $BD + DC = BC = 8$, we have $3x + 5x = 8$, so $x = 1$. Therefore, $BD = 3$ and $DC = 5$.\n\nNext, we apply Stewart's Theorem which states that for any triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $c$, and a cevian $d$ dividing side $a$ into two segments of length $m$ and $n$, the following relationship holds: $b^2m + c^2n = amn + d^2a$. In our case, $a = 8$, $b = 6$, $c = 10$, $m = 3$, $n = 5$, and $d = AD$. Plugging in these values, we get $6^2 \cdot 5 + 10^2 \cdot 3 = 8 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + AD^2 \cdot 8$. Simplifying, we get $180 + 300 = 120 + 8AD^2$, or $480 = 120 + 8AD^2$. Solving for $AD^2$, we get $AD^2 = (480 - 120) / 8 = 360 / 8 = 45$.",

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 8. Extracted: {"answer": 3.9}

To solve the problem:

The energy of a photon ($E$) is related to its wavelength ($\lambda$) by the formula:
\[ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]
where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.

Given that a photon with 2000 times the energy of a red photon has a wavelength we need to find, let's denote:
- The energy of the red photon as \( E_{red} \)
- The wavelength of the red photon as \( \lambda_{red} = 7 \times 10^{-7} \) meters

For the red photon:
\[ E_{red} = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{red}} \]

A photon with 2000 times the energy of the red photon:
\[ E_{new} = 2000 \cdot E_{red} \]
\[ E_{new} = 2000 \cdot \frac{hc}{\lambda_{red}} \]

Let \(\lambda_{new}\) be the wavelength of the photon with 2000 times the energy:
\[ E_{new} = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{new}} \]
\[ 2000 \cdot \frac{hc}{\lambda_{red}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{new}} \]
Cancel out \( hc \):
\[ 2000 \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda_{red}} = \frac{1}{\lambda_{new}} \]
\[ \lambda_{new} = \frac{\lambda_{red}}{2000} \]
\[ \lambda_{new} = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2000} \]
\[ \lambda_{new} = 3.5 \times 10^{-10} \text{ meters} \]

Expressing in scientific notation, \(\lambda_{new} = 3.5 \times 10^{-10}\) meters, so:
\[ a = 3.5 \]
\[ b = -10 \]
\[ a + b = 3.5 - 10 = -6.5 \]

But since we need \(a\) in the range \(1 \leq a < 10\), we rewrite it as:
\[ 3.5 \times 10^{-10} \text{ meters} = 3.5 \times 10^{b} \text{ meters}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 11. Extracted: {5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

This shaded region includes a sector of the larger circle minus the corresponding sector of the smaller circle. Let the central angle of both sectors be $\theta$ radians.

The area of a sector of a circle with radius $r$ and central angle $\theta$ radians is given by:
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\]

For the larger circle (radius $2$):
\[
\text{Area of sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]

For the smaller circle (radius $1$):
\[
\text{Area of sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

Thus, the shaded area can also be expressed as:
\[
\text{Shaded area} = 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta - \theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}
\]

Setting this equal to the previously calculated shaded area:
\[
\frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Solving for $\theta$:
\[
3\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9}
\]

Since we need the angle in degrees, we convert radians to degrees using $\pi$ radians $= 180^\circ$:
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{1800^\circ}{9} = 200^\circ
\]

Therefore, the measure of $\angle ADC$ is:
\[

### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Smaller Triangles
Next, consider the smaller triangles within the diagram:

- There is a smaller right triangle at the bottom with base \(3\) cm and height \(8\) cm (since the height is the same as the larger triangle).
  
The area \(A_1\) of this smaller triangle is:
\[ A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 8 = 12 \text{ cm}^2 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region
The shaded region can be found by subtracting the area of the smaller triangle from the area of the larger triangle.

\[ \text{Shaded Area} = \text{Area of Larger Triangle} - \text{Area of Smaller Triangle} \]
\[ \text{Shaded Area} = 24 \text{ cm}^2 - 12 \text{ cm}^2 = 12 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n \) for all \( n \geq 1 \).
   - \( \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} \) is real for all \( n \geq 1 \).
   - \( \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \).

2. **Analyzing the Sequence:**
   Using the recurrence relation:
   \[
   z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n,
   \]
   we can write out a few terms:
   \[
   z_3 = z_2^2 z_1,
   \]
   \[
   z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2.
   \]

3. **Magnitude Conditions:**
   From the magnitude condition \( \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = 2 \):
   \[
   \left| \frac{z_3}{z_4} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2} \right| = \left| \frac{z_1}{z_2^3 z_1} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^3} \right| = 2,
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   |z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]
   Similarly, from \( \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = 2 \):
   \[
   \left| \frac{z_4}{z_5} \right| = \left| \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{(z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 z_2} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^2} \right| = 2,
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   |z_2|^7 |z_1|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

4. **Real Condition:**
   Given that \( \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} \) is real for all \( n \geq 1 \), we need to ensure that \( \frac{z_3}{z_1^2} \) and \( \frac{z_4}{z_2^2} \) are real. Let’s compute these ratios:
   \[
   \frac{z_3}{z_1^2} = \frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_1^2} = z_2^2,
   \]
   and
   \[
   \frac{z_4}{z_2^2} = \frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^2} = z_2^3 z_1^2.
   \]
   Since \( z_2^2 \) and \( z_2^3 z_1^2 \) must be real, \( z_2 \) and \( z_1 \) must have specific phase relationships. Let \( z_2 = r e^{i \theta} \) and \( z_1 = s e^{i \phi} \). Then:
   \[
   r^2 e^{2i \theta} \text{ and } r^3 s^2 e^{i(3\theta + 2\phi)} \text{ are real}.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   2\theta \equiv 0 \pmod{\pi} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = k \pi / 2,
   \]
   and
   \[
   3\theta + 2\phi \equiv 0 \pmod{\pi}.
   \]
   Given \( r^3 = (1/2)^{1/3} \), we find \( r = (1/2)^{1/9} \).

5. **Possible Values of \( z_1 \):**
   With \( \theta = k \pi / 2 \), we have:
   \[
   z_2 = (1/2)^{1/9} e^{i k \pi / 2},
   \]
   where \( k \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \).

   For each \( k \), we determine \( \phi \) such that \( 3(k \pi / 2) + 2\phi \equiv 0 \pmod{\pi} \):
   \[
   \phi = -\frac{3k \pi}{4} + m \pi \quad \text{for some integer } m.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   z_1 = (1/2)^{1/18} e^{i (-3k \pi / 4 + m \pi)}.
   \]
   The distinct values for \( z_1 \) are:
   \[
   (1/2)^{1/18} e^{i \pi / 4}, (1/2)^{1/18} e^{i 3 \pi / 4}, (1/2)^{1/18} e^{-i \pi / 4}, (1/2)^{1/18} e^{-i 3 \pi / 4}.
   \]

6. **Product of All Possible Values:**
   The product of these values:
   \[
   (1/2)^{1/18} e^{i \pi / 4} \cdot (1/2)^{1/18} e^{i 3 \pi / 4} \cdot (1/2)^{1/18} e^{-i \pi / 4} \cdot (1/2)^{1/18} e^{-i 3 \pi / 4} = (1/2)^{4/18} (e^{i \pi / 4} e^{i 3 \pi / 4} e^{-i \pi / 4} e^{-i 3 \pi / 4}) = (1/2)^{2/9} \cdot 1 = (1/2)^{2/9}.
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{(1/2)^{2/9}}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 29. Extracted: {z} = a - bi \).

Given the equations:
\[ a + \frac{17a + 6b}{a^2 + b^2} = 6, \]
\[ b + \frac{6a - 17b}{a^2 + b^2} = 0, \]

we can express these in terms of \( z \) and \( \bar{z} \). Note that \( a^2 + b^2 = |z|^2 \). We also know that:
\[ z = a + bi, \]
\[ \bar{z} = a - bi. \]

Thus, the equations become:
\[ \text{Re}(z) + \frac{17 \cdot \text{Re}(z) + 6 \cdot \text{Im}(z)}{|z|^2} = 6, \]
\[ \text{Im}(z) + \frac{6 \cdot \text{Re}(z) - 17 \cdot \text{Im}(z)}{|z|^2} = 0. \]

Rewriting in terms of \( z \):
\[ \text{Re}(z) + \frac{17z + 6i\bar{z}}{|z|^2} = 6, \]
\[ \text{Im}(z) + \frac{6z - 17i\bar{z}}{|z|^2} = 0. \]

Combining these into a single complex equation:
\[ z + \frac{17z + 6i\bar{z}}{|z|^2} = 6 + i \cdot 0. \]

Simplify:
\[ z + \frac{17z + 6i\bar{z}}{|z|^2} = 6. \]

Since \( |z|^2 = z\bar{z} \):
\[ z + \frac{17z + 6i\bar{z}}{z\bar{z}} = 6. \]

Multiplying through by \( z\bar{z} \):
\[ z^2\bar{z} + 17z + 6i\bar{z} = 6z\bar{z}. \]

Separating real and imaginary parts:
\[ (z^2 + 17z)\bar{z} + 6i\bar{z} = 6z\bar{z}. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ (z^2 + 17z + 6i)\bar{z} = 6z\bar{z}. \]

Dividing both sides by \( \bar{z} \):
\[ z^2 + 17z + 6i = 6z. \]

Rearranging gives:
\[ z^2 + 11z + 6i = 0. \]

This quadratic equation in \( z \) has roots which we solve using the quadratic formula:
\[ z = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{121 - 24i}}{2}. \]

To find the roots, we simplify \( \sqrt{121 - 24i} \). Let \( w = u + vi \) where \( u \) and \( v \) are real numbers. Then:
\[ w^2 = u^2 - v^2 + 2uvi = 121 - 24i. \]

Equating real and imaginary parts:
\[ u^2 - v^2 = 121, \]
\[ 2uv = -24. \]

Solving for \( u \) and \( v \):
\[ uv = -12, \]
\[ v = -\frac{12}{u}, \]
\[ u^2 - \left(-\frac{12}{u}\right)^2 = 121, \]
\[ u^2 - \frac{144}{u^2} = 121, \]
\[ u^4 - 121u^2 - 144 = 0. \]

Letting \( x = u^2 \):
\[ x^2 - 121x - 144 = 0. \]

Solving this quadratic:
\[ x = \frac{121 \pm \sqrt{14641 + 576}}{2} = \frac{121 \pm 125}{2}. \]

So:
\[ x = 123 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

Since \( x = u^2 \geq 0 \), we have \( u^2 = 123 \). Thus:
\[ u = \sqrt{123} \quad \text{and} \quad v = -\frac{12}{\sqrt{123}} = -\frac{12\sqrt{123}}{123} = -\frac{4\sqrt{123}}{41}. \]

Therefore, the roots are:
\[ z = \frac{-11 + \sqrt{121 - 24i}}{2} = \frac{-11 + \sqrt{123} - i\frac{4\sqrt{123}}{41}}{2}, \]
\[ \bar{z} = \frac{-11 - \sqrt{123} + i\frac{4\sqrt{123}}{41}}{2}. \]

Summing all \( a_i + b_i \):
\[ \left(\frac{-11 + \sqrt{123}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{-11 - \sqrt{123}}{2}\right) = -11. \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{-11}

- $2122_3 = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0 = 54 + 9 + 6 + 2 = 71_{10}$
- $1200_3 = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 0 \cdot 3^0 = 27 + 18 + 0 + 0 = 45_{10}$
- $2111_3 = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 54 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 67_{10}$

Now, substitute these decimal values into the expression:
\[16 + 71 - 45 - 67\]

Perform the arithmetic operations step-by-step:
\[16 + 71 = 87\]
\[87 - 45 = 42\]
\[42 - 67 = -25\]

We now have $-25_{10}$. We need to convert this negative decimal number back to base 3. Since base 3 only represents positive integers, converting directly from a negative decimal might involve expressing it in terms of a positive base 3 equivalent, typically with a sign prefix or as a direct transformation process in the context where negative bases are handled appropriately (for simplicity, we assume direct conversion without signs).

To find the base 3 equivalent of $-25$, consider the positive value $25_{10}$ first:
\[25_{10} = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 2 \cdot 27 + 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 1 = 54 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 70\]
\[25 = 2 \cdot 27 + 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 2121_3\]

Thus, the base 3 representation of $-25$ can be expressed as $-\overline{2121}_3$ but since we are asked to express the answer in base 3 without signs:
\[ -25_{10} = -\overline{2121}_3 \]

However, traditionally, we handle this as:
\[ -25_{10} = -2121_3 \]

So, the final answer is:

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 55. Extracted: {pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, let's compute the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The right-hand side (RHS) is already given as:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We equate the corresponding elements of the LHS and RHS:

1. \(a^2 + bc = c\)
2. \(ab + bd = a\)
3. \(ac + dc = d\)
4. \(bc + d^2 = b\)

Let's analyze each equation separately:

### Equation 1: \(a^2 + bc = c\)
Rewriting, we get:
\[ a^2 + bc - c = 0 \]
\[ a^2 + c(b-1) = 0 \]
\[ c = -\frac{a^2}{b-1} \quad \text{(assuming } b \neq 1\text{)} \]

### Equation 2: \(ab + bd = a\)
Factor out \(b\) from the left side:
\[ ab + bd = a \]
\[ b(a + d) = a \]
If \(a \neq 0\), then:
\[ b = \frac{a}{a+d} \]

### Equation 3: \(ac + dc = d\)
Factor out \(c\) from the left side:
\[ ac + dc = d \]
\[ c(a + d) = d \]
If \(d \neq 0\), then:
\[ c = \frac{d}{a+d} \]

### Equation 4: \(bc + d^2 = b\)
Rewriting, we get:
\[ bc + d^2 - b = 0 \]
\[ b(c-1) + d^2 = 0 \]
\[ d^2 = b(1-c) \]

Now we have four equations:
1. \(c = -\frac{a^2}{b-1}\)
2. \(b = \frac{a}{a+d}\)
3. \(c = \frac{d}{a+d}\)
4. \(d^2 = b(1-c)\)

By comparing Equations 2 and 3:
\[ \frac{a}{a+d} = \frac{a+d}{a} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ a^2 = (a+d)^2 \]
\[ a^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 \]
\[ 0 = 2ad + d^2 \]
\[ d(d + 2a) = 0 \]
Thus, either \(d = 0\) or \(d = -2a\).

#### Case 1: \(d = 0\)
Substituting \(d = 0\) into Equations 2 and 3:
\[ b = \frac{a}{a+0} = 1 \]
\[ c = \frac{0}{a+0} = 0 \]
Substituting \(b = 1\) and \(c = 0\) into Equation 4:
\[ 0^2 = 1(1-0) \Rightarrow 0 = 1 \]
This is a contradiction.

#### Case 2: \(d = -2a\)
Substituting \(d = -2a\) into Equations 2 and 3:
\[ b = \frac{a}{a + (-2a)} = \frac{a}{-a} = -1 \]
\[ c = \frac{-2a}{a + (-2a)} = \frac{-2a}{-a} = 2 \]
Substituting \(b = -1\) and \(c = 2\) into Equation 1:
\[ a^2 + 2(-1) = 2 \]
\[ a^2 - 2 = 2 \]
\[ a^2 = 4 \]
\[ a = \pm 2 \]

Therefore, there are two valid solutions:
1. \( (a, b, c, d) = (2, -1, 2, -4) \)
2. \( (a, b, c, d) = (-2, -1, 2, 4) \)

Hence, the total number of ordered quadruples \((a, b, c, d)\) is:
\[
\boxed{2}

- The radius of the second-largest semicircle is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
- The radius of the third-largest semicircle is \(4 \, \text{cm}\).
- The radius of the smallest semicircle is \(2 \, \text{cm}\).

The area of a semicircle with radius \(r\) is given by:
\[ A_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \]

Let's compute the areas:

1. **Area of the largest semicircle (radius = 8 cm):**
   \[
   A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (8^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi (64) = 32 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   
2. **Area of the second-largest semicircle (radius = 6 cm):**
   \[
   A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (6^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi (36) = 18 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   
3. **Area of the third-largest semicircle (radius = 4 cm):**
   \[
   A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi (16) = 8 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   
4. **Area of the smallest semicircle (radius = 2 cm):**
   \[
   A_4 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4) = 2 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

Next, we calculate the areas of the shaded regions:
- Shaded region 1 (largest semicircle minus the second-largest semicircle):
  \[
  \text{Shaded Region 1} = A_1 - A_2 = 32 \pi - 18 \pi = 14 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
  \]
  
- Shaded region 2 (third-largest semicircle minus the smallest semicircle):
  \[
  \text{Shaded Region 2} = A_3 - A_4 = 8 \pi - 2 \pi = 6 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
  \]

Finally, summing up the areas of the shaded regions:
\[
\text{Total Shaded Area} = 14 \pi + 6 \pi = 20 \pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[
20 \pi \approx 20 \times 3.14 = 62.8 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Thus, the total area of the two shaded regions is:
\[

\[ w^{11} = z \]

Substituting the first equation into the second:
\[ (z^{13})^{11} = z \]
\[ z^{143} = z \]

Since \( z \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( z \):
\[ z^{142} = 1 \]

This implies that \( z \) is a 142nd root of unity. Therefore, we can write \( z \) as:
\[ z = e^{2k\pi i / 142} = e^{k\pi i / 71} \]
for some integer \( k \).

Now, the imaginary part of \( z \) is given by:
\[ \operatorname{Im}(z) = \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{71}\right) \]

We are asked to find the denominator \( n \) such that \( \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{71}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{n}\right) \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime integers with \( m < n \).

From the above, we see that:
\[ \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{71}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{71}\right) \]

Thus, \( n \) must be 71 since \( k \) and \( m \) are related through the sine function and 71 is the smallest denominator making \( \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{71}\right) \) well-defined.

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:
\[ \boxed{71}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 69. Extracted: {Midpoint of AC} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
   \]

2. Calculate the midpoint of BD:
   \[
   \text{Midpoint of BD} = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
   \]

Since these midpoints are equal, we set them equal to each other:

\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Solve Equation 1 for \( x \):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, since \( x > 7 \), there was an oversight. Let's re-evaluate with correct algebraic manipulations:

From Equation 1:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6 \quad \text{(But \( x > 7 \))}
\]

Revisiting properly:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6 \quad \text{(Error here; correct as \( x = 8 \))}
\]

Correctly:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6 \quad (\text{Fixing: } x = 8)
\]

Solve Equation 2 for \( y \):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus:
\[
x = 8, y = -1
\]

Finally,
\[
x + y = 8 - 1 = 7
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 87. Extracted: {10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}
\]

First, recall the definition of the binomial coefficients:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

We can rewrite the inequality as:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} = \frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!}
\]
\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 1 - (k-1))!} = \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Substitute these into the inequality:
\[
\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Simplify the factorials:
\[
\frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{(10^9 + 1)(10^9)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Cancel \(10^9!\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{k(10^9 - k)!} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Simplify further:
\[
\frac{1}{k} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{(k-1)(10^9 + 2 - k)}
\]

Multiply through by \(k(k-1)(10^9 + 2 - k)\):
\[
(k-1)(10^9 + 2 - k) < k(10^9 + 1)
\]

Expand and simplify:
\[
(k-1)(10^9 + 2 - k) = (k-1)(10^9 + 2 - k) = k(10^9 + 2 - k) - (10^9 + 2 - k)
= k \cdot 10^9 + 2k - k^2 - 10^9 - 2 + k
= 10^9 k + 3k - k^2 - 10^9 - 2
\]

So the inequality becomes:
\[
10^9 k + 3k - k^2 - 10^9 - 2 < 10^9 k + k
\]

Simplify:
\[
-k^2 + 3k - 10^9 - 2 < k
\]

Rearrange terms:
\[
-k^2 + 2k - 10^9 - 2 < 0
\]

This is a quadratic inequality:
\[
k^2 - 2k + 10^9 + 2 > 0
\]

To find the smallest \( k \), solve the quadratic equation:
\[
k^2 - 2k + 10^9 + 2 = 0
\]

Use the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -2\), \(c = 10^9 + 2\):
\[
k = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(10^9 + 2)}}{2}
\]
\[
k = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4 \times 10^9 - 8}}{2}
\]
\[
k = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4 \times 10^9 - 4}}{2}
\]

Since the discriminant is negative, it suggests an approximation:
\[
k \approx 10^9 / 2 = 5 \times 10^8
\]

The smallest integer greater than \( 5 \times 10^8 \) is \( k = 500000001 \).

Thus, \( k = 500000001 \). First digit \( a = 5 \), second digit \( b = 0 \).

Finally, compute \( 10a + b \):
\[
10a + b = 10 \times 5 + 0 = 50
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[

Since \( c \) is a positive integer, we have:
\[ c = 8 \]

Using \( b = c + 1 \):
\[ b = 8 + 1 = 9 \]

Finally, the sum \( b + c \) is:
\[ b + c = 9 + 8 = 17 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}
