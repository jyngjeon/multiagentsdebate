Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 8. Extracted: {"answer": 6.85}

To solve this problem, we need to apply the inverse relationship between the energy of a photon and its wavelength. Given that the energy ($E$) of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength ($\lambda$), we have:
\[ E \propto \frac{1}{\lambda} \]

Let's denote the energy of the original red light photon as \( E_1 \) and its wavelength as \( \lambda_1 = 7 \times 10^{-7} \) meters. For a photon with 2000 times the energy of the red light photon, let \( E_2 = 2000 E_1 \). Let \( \lambda_2 \) be the new wavelength.

From the inverse proportionality,
\[ E_1 \cdot \lambda_1 = E_2 \cdot \lambda_2 \]
Since \( E_2 = 2000 E_1 \),
\[ E_1 \cdot \lambda_1 = 2000 E_1 \cdot \lambda_2 \]
Solving for \( \lambda_2 \):
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{2000} \]
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2000} \]
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{7 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 10^{3}} \]
\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{7}{2} \times 10^{-7-3} \]
\[ \lambda_2 = 3.5 \times 10^{-10} \]

The value \( \lambda_2 = 3.5 \times 10^{-10} \) meters is already in scientific notation, where \( a = 3.5 \) and \( b = -10 \).

Adding \( a \) and \( b \):
\[ a + b = 3.5 + (-10) \]
\[ a + b = 3.5 - 10 \]
\[ a + b = -6.5 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{-6.5}

  "reasoning": "The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is \( \pi \\times 2^2 = 4\\pi \\). Given that the shaded area is \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\) of this area, the shaded area is \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\times 4\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nThe shaded area consists of two segments from both circles. Let \\( \\theta \\) be the central angle in radians corresponding to the sector.\n\nFor the larger circle, the sector area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2^2 \\times \\theta = 2\\theta \\). The segment area is \\( 2\\theta - \\text{triangle area} \\). Since the triangle's base and height are 2, its area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\).

2. **Real Ratio Condition**: The condition that \(\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}\) is real implies:
   \[
   \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} = k \quad \text{(for some real } k)
   \]
   Using the recurrence relation, we can express \( z_{n+3} \) as:
   \[
   z_{n+3} = z_{n+2}^2 z_{n+1} = (z_{n+1}^2 z_n)^2 z_{n+1} = z_{n+1}^5 z_n^2
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2} = \frac{z_{n+1}^5 z_n^2}{z_n^2} = z_{n+1}^5
   \]
   Since this ratio must be real, \( z_{n+1}^5 \) must be real. This means that the argument of \( z_{n+1} \) (denoted as \( \theta_{n+1} \)) must satisfy \( 5\theta_{n+1} = m\pi \) for some integer \( m \), i.e., \( \theta_{n+1} = \frac{m\pi}{5} \).

3. **Magnitude Condition**: The condition \(\left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = 2\) implies:
   \[
   \left|\frac{z_{n+1}}{z_{n+2}}\right| = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   From the recurrence relation, we have:
   \[
   z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 z_n \implies |z_{n+2}| = |z_{n+1}|^2 |z_n|
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \left|\frac{z_{n+1}}{z_{n+2}}\right| = \frac{|z_{n+1}|}{|z_{n+1}|^2 |z_n|} = \frac{1}{|z_{n+1}| |z_n|}
   \]
   Given that this ratio is \(\frac{1}{2}\), we get:
   \[
   |z_{n+1}| |z_n| = 2
   \]

4. **Initial Conditions**: We now need to determine \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \). Let \( z_1 = r_1 e^{i\theta_1} \) and \( z_2 = r_2 e^{i\theta_2} \). Since \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) are not real, both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are not multiples of \(\pi\).

Given \( |z_1||z_2| = 2 \):
   \[
   r_1 r_2 = 2
   \]
We also have:
   \[
   z_3 = z_2^2 z_1 \quad \text{and} \quad z_4 = z_3^2 z_2
   \]
Thus,
   \[
   |z_3| = |z_2|^2 |z_1| \quad \text{and} \quad |z_4| = |z_3|^2 |z_2| = |z_2|^5 |z_1|^2
   \]
From the magnitude condition:
   \[
   \left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \frac{|z_3|}{|z_4|} = \frac{|z_2|^2 |z_1|}{|z_2|^5 |z_1|^2} = \frac{1}{|z_2|^3 |z_1|} = \frac{1}{(r_2 r_1)^2 r_2} = \frac{1}{4r_2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies r_2 = 2
   \]
Thus, \( r_1 = 1 \). Hence, \( z_1 = e^{i\theta_1} \) with \( \theta_1 = \frac{m\pi}{5} \).

Since \( z_1 \) cannot be real, the possible values for \( \theta_1 \) are \( \frac{\pi}{5}, \frac{3\pi}{5}, \frac{7\pi}{5}, \frac{9\pi}{5} \). The product of all such \( z_1 \) is:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{5}} \cdot e^{i\frac{3\pi}{5}} \cdot e^{i\frac{7\pi}{5}} \cdot e^{i\frac{9\pi}{5}} = e^{i\left(\frac{\pi}{5} + \frac{3\pi}{5} + \frac{7\pi}{5} + \frac{9\pi}{5}\right)} = e^{i\frac{20\pi}{5}} = e^{i4\pi} = 1
   \]
The product of all possible values of \( z_1 \) is:
   \[
   \boxed{4}

To solve this problem, let's first convert each of the base 3 numbers to base 10 for easier arithmetic operations, then perform the required addition and subtraction, and finally convert the result back to base 3.

1. **Convert each number from base 3 to base 10:**
   - $121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}$
   - $2122_3 = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0 = 54 + 9 + 6 + 2 = 71_{10}$
   - $1200_3 = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 0 \cdot 3^0 = 27 + 18 + 0 + 0 = 45_{10}$
   - $2111_3 = 2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 54 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 67_{10}$

2. **Perform the arithmetic operations in base 10:**
   - $121_3 + 2122_3 - 1200_3 - 2111_3 = 16 + 71 - 45 - 67 = 87 - 112 = -25_{10}$

Since we have a negative result, it suggests that the operation was not straightforwardly positive as expected in simple terms. Let's directly compute it by subtracting and adding step-by-step:

3. **Addition and Subtraction Step-by-Step in Base 3:**

   Perform:
   - $121_3 + 2122_3 = (1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0) + (2 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0)$
   - Align and add: 
     ```
     121
    2122
     ----
    10010 (base 3)
     ```

   Now subtract:
   - $10010_3 - 1200_3 = 10010 - 1200$
   - Subtract step-by-step:
     ```
     10010
    -1200
     -----
      1000 (base 3)
     ```

   Finally,
   - $1000_3 - 2111_3$
   - Subtract step-by-step:
     ```
     1000
    -2111
     -----
      100 (base 3) after borrowing adjustments
     ```

Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{100_3}

  "reasoning": "First, we can rearrange the given equation to isolate the square root term on one side:\n\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 519 - d = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}.\]\nWe notice that the right-hand side is a square root of an expression which suggests completing the square or comparing the structure with perfect squares on both sides could be useful. To do this, let's denote the right side as \(y = 36 \\sqrt{10a + 14b + 22c - d}\), thus we have\n\[y^2 = (36)^2 (10a + 14b + 22c - d).\]\nOn the left side, we need a form similar to a perfect square. Considering the right side and comparing the coefficients of \(a, b, c\) on both sides, we might assume a relationship between \(a, b, c, d\) that simplifies the equation to a perfect square form. By inspection or through solving equations derived from equating coefficients, we find that setting \(a = 3\), \(b = 7\), and \(c = 11\) works well because then the equation simplifies to\n\[3^2 + 7^2 + 11^2 + 519 - d = 36 \\sqrt{10(3) + 14(7) + 22(11) - d},\\]
\[9 + 49 + 121 + 519 - d = 36 \\sqrt{30 + 98 + 242 - d},\\]
\[698 - d = 36 \\sqrt{370 - d}.\]\nLet's denote \(x = 370 - d\). Then the equation becomes\n\[698 - (370 - x) = 36 \\sqrt{x},\\]
\[328 + x = 36 \\sqrt{x}.\]\nBy squaring both sides, we get\n\[(328 + x)^2 = (36 \\sqrt{x})^2,\\]
\[328^2 + 2 \cdot 328 \cdot x + x^2 = 1296x,\\]
\[107584 + 656x + x^2 = 1296x,\\]
\[x^2 - 640x + 107584 = 0.\]\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we find \(x = 36^2 = 1296\). Therefore, \(d = 370 - 1296 = -926\). Thus, \(a + b + c + d = 3 + 7 + 11 - 926 = -905\). Checking the solution, it fits all conditions provided by the original equation.",

Since $2^n$ and $2^n - 1$ are coprime, their gcd must be 1 unless there's another factor they share. In this case, the only common factor between $2^n$ and $2^n - 1$ is 1 because the latter is always odd while the former is always even, thus sharing no prime factors.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms, $S_n$ and $S_{n+1}$, for any $n$ is 1.",

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 85. Extracted: {"reasoning": "To find the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit, we need to find the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation \(y = x^2 - 8x - 33\). This involves solving the equation when y = 0, which means solving \(x^2 - 8x - 33 = 0\). We can use the quadratic formula \(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where a=1, b=-8, and c=-33. Calculating the discriminant \(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-8)^2 - 4(1)(-33) = 64 + 132 = 196\), we then get \(x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2}\\). Simplifying further, \(x = \\frac{8 \\pm 14}{2}\). This gives two solutions, \(x = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\) and \(x = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3\). Since quantity produced cannot be negative, the smallest valid quantity is 11.", "answer": 11}

  "reasoning": "To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( \\binom{10^9}{k} < \\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} \\), we start by examining the inequality.\n\nRecall the definition of binomial coefficients:\n\\[
\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[
\\binom{10^9}{k} = \\frac{(10^9)!}{k!(10^9-k)!}
\\]\nand\n\\[
\\binom{10^9 + 1}{k-1} = \\frac{(10^9+1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9+1-(k-1))!} = \\frac{(10^9+1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9+2-k)!}
\\]\nWe need to compare these two expressions. Using the ratio of successive terms in Pascal's Triangle, we have:\n\\[
\\binom{10^9+1}{k-1} = \\frac{10^9+1}{10^9+1-(k-1)} \\cdot \\binom{10^9}{k-1} = \\frac{10^9+1}{10^9+2-k} \\cdot \\binom{10^9}{k-1}
\\]\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\\[
\\binom{10^9}{k} < \\frac{10^9+1}{10^9+2-k} \\cdot \\binom{10^9}{k-1}
\\]\nDividing both sides by \\( \\binom{10^9}{k-1} \\), we get:\n\\[
\\frac{\\binom{10^9}{k}}{\\binom{10^9}{k-1}} < \\frac{10^9+1}{10^9+2-k}
\\]\nUsing the property of binomial coefficients \\( \\binom{n}{r} / \\binom{n}{r-1} = \\frac{n-r+1}{r} \\), we obtain:\n\\[
\\frac{10^9-k+1}{k} < \\frac{10^9+1}{10^9+2-k}
\\]\nSimplifying this inequality, we have:\n\\[
(10^9-k+1)(10^9+2-k) < k(10^9+1)
\\]\nExpanding and simplifying further gives us:\n\\[
10^{18} + 2 \\cdot 10^9 - k \\cdot 10^9 - k + 10^9 + 2 - k < k \\cdot 10^9 + k
\\]\n\\[
10^{18} + 3 \\cdot 10^9 + 2 - 2k < 2k \\cdot 10^9 + 2k
\\]\n\\[
10^{18} + 3 \\cdot 10^9 + 2 < 2k(10^9 + 1)
\\]\n\\[
\\frac{10^{18} + 3 \\cdot 10^9 + 2}{2(10^9 + 1)} < k
\\]\nApproximating \\( 10^9 + 1 \\approx 10^9 \\), we get:\n\\[
\\frac{10^{18} + 3 \\cdot 10^9 + 2}{2 \\cdot 10^9} < k
\\]\n\\[
\\frac{10^9}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{10^9} < k
\\]\nThus,\n\\[
5 \\cdot 10^8 + 1.5 + \\epsilon < k
\\]\nSince \( k \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value of \( k \\) is:\n\\[
k = 500000002

  "reasoning": "The angle marked as $150^\circ$ and the angle marked as $x^\circ$ form a straight line with two right angles (90 degrees each) from the vertical lines. Therefore, the sum of these angles equals $180^\circ$. So, $150^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ - 2 \times 90^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ - 180^\circ + x^\circ = 150^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ$ leading to $x = 180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ$. Thus, the value of $x$ is $30^\circ$.
