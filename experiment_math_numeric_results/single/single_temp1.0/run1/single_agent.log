  "reasoning": "To find the vertex of the parabola given by the equation \(y = -2x^2 - 12x - 15\), we can use the vertex formula for a parabola in standard form, \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\). The x-coordinate of the vertex, \(m\), is given by \(m = -\\frac{b}{2a}\).\n\nHere, \(a = -2\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -15\). Therefore, \(m = -\\frac{-12}{2(-2)} = \\frac{12}{-4} = -3\).\n\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, \(n\), we substitute \(m = -3\) back into the original equation:\n\(n = -2(-3)^2 - 12(-3) - 15 = -2(9) + 36 - 15 = -18 + 36 - 15 = 3\).\nThus, the coordinates of the vertex are \((-3, 3)\).\n\nSo, \(m + n = -3 + 3 = 0\).",

  "reasoning": "First, recognize that the triangle $\triangle ABC$ with sides $AB=6$, $BC=8$, and $CA=10$ forms a right triangle because $6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2$. According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, the angle bisector of angle A divides the opposite side BC into segments BD and DC proportional to the adjacent sides AB and AC, respectively. So, $BD/DC = AB/AC = 6/10 = 3/5$. Since $BC = 8$, we can set up the equation $BD + DC = 8$ and substitute $BD = 3x$ and $DC = 5x$ leading to $3x + 5x = 8$ or $8x = 8$. Thus, $x = 1$, so $BD = 3$ and $DC = 5$. Using Stewart's Theorem for $\triangle ABC$ with cevian AD, we get $AB^2 \cdot DC + AC^2 \cdot BD = AD^2 \cdot BC + BD \cdot DC \cdot BC$. Substituting the values gives $6^2 \cdot 5 + 10^2 \cdot 3 = AD^2 \cdot 8 + 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 8$. Simplifying yields $180 + 300 = 8AD^2 + 120$ or $480 = 8AD^2 + 120$. Therefore, $360 = 8AD^2$ and dividing by 8 results in $AD^2 = 45$.",

The product of all possible values of $z_1$ will include all possible valid values of $\\theta_1$ leading to distinct complex numbers while respecting the modulus constraint. The product of all such possible values of $z_1$ will be the square of the modulus of one solution due to symmetry and conjugate pairs.\n\nThe product of all possible values of $z_1$ is therefore:\\[ 2^{\\frac{13}{8}}. \\]",

  "reasoning": "Firstly, let's interpret the given equations using complex numbers. Let \( z = a + bi \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers. Then the equations become:\n\n\[
z + \frac{17a + 6b + (6a - 17b)i}{a^2 + b^2} = 6.

z + \frac{(17a + 6b) + i(6a - 17b)}{a^2 + b^2} = 6.
\]\n\nNotice that the numerator is exactly \( z \cdot (17 + 6i) \). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\[
z + \frac{z \cdot (17 + 6i)}{|z|^2} = 6.
\]\n\nSince \( |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2 \), we have:\n\n\[
z + \frac{z \cdot (17 + 6i)}{|z|^2} = 6 \Rightarrow z \left(1 + \frac{17 + 6i}{|z|^2}\right) = 6.

The second equation \( b + \frac{6a - 17b}{a^2 + b^2} = 0 \) suggests a conjugate symmetry, implying that if \( z = a + bi \) is a solution, then \( \overline{z} = a - bi \) is also a solution.\n\nGiven that the system has symmetric properties, the sum of all \( a_i + b_i \) pairs will cancel out due to the conjugate nature of the roots. Thus, the sum \( a_1 + b_1 + a_2 + b_2 + \dots + a_n + b_n \) is 0.",

  "answer": "-1012"
}

However, my initial response included an incorrect negative representation and an incomplete final conversion process. Let's directly compute the base 3 arithmetic operation:

1. Directly convert and sum/subtract in base 3:
   - $121_3 + 2122_3 = 2300_3$
   - Subtract $1200_3$: $2300_3 - 1200_3 = 1100_3$
   - Subtract $2111_3$: $1100_3 - 2111_3$ requires borrowing, resulting in $-1012_3$

Thus, the correct answer in base 3, properly handling borrow and carry:

  "reasoning": "To find the sum of the altitudes of an isosceles triangle with sides 10, 10, and 12, we start by calculating the area of the triangle using Heron's formula or by splitting the triangle into two right triangles. Given the symmetry, splitting it into two right triangles gives a straightforward calculation.\n\nSplitting the base of 12 into two segments of 6 each, we can form two right triangles with legs 6 and the altitude (h) and hypotenuse 10. Using Pythagoras theorem: \(6^2 + h^2 = 10^2 \Rightarrow 36 + h^2 = 100 \Rightarrow h^2 = 64 \Rightarrow h = 8\). So, the altitude to the base of 12 is 8.\n\nThe other two altitudes can be found by considering the area of the triangle. Area can be calculated as \(A = \\frac{1}{2}bh = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(8) = 48\). For the altitude to one of the equal sides, \(A = \\frac{1}{2}(10)h' = 48 \Rightarrow h' = \\frac{96}{10} = 9.6\). Since the triangle is symmetric, both altitudes to the equal sides are 9.6.\n\nSumming these altitudes: \(8 + 9.6 + 9.6 = 27.2\).",

  "reasoning": "Let's denote the smaller perfect square as \(a^2\) and the larger perfect square as \(b^2\), with \(b > a\). According to the problem, the difference between these squares is 99, so we have the equation \(b^2 - a^2 = 99\). This can be factored using the difference of squares formula as \((b-a)(b+a) = 99\). We also know that there are exactly two perfect squares between \(a^2\) and \(b^2\), meaning that \(b^2 - a^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = 34\) or another combination that fits within the constraint but here directly \(b^2 - a^2 = 99\) already fits the scenario of two perfect squares in between due to spacing properties of perfect squares.\n\nThe factor pairs of 99 are (1, 99), (3, 33), (9, 11). Since \(b > a\), the reasonable factor pair should satisfy both \(b-a < b+a\) and \(b-a\) close enough to ensure two perfect squares between them. The pair (9, 11) satisfies this condition well because it gives \(b-a = 9\) and \(b+a = 11\).\n\nAdding these equations, we get \(2b = 20\) so \(b = 10\). Subtracting, we get \(2a = 2\) so \(a = 1\). Thus, the squares are \(1^2 = 1\) and \(10^2 = 100\). The two perfect squares between 1 and 100 are indeed 16 and 36, confirming our solution.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two perfect squares on the board is \(1 + 100 = 101\).",

  "reasoning": "The sum of the first $n$ powers of $2$, starting from $2^0$, can be expressed as $S_n = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \\ldots + 2^{n-1}$. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of $2$ and the sum formula for such a series is $S_n = \\frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1$. Therefore, we have $S_n = 2^n - 1$ and $S_{n+1} = 2^{n+1} - 1$.\n\nTo find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $S_n$ and $S_{n+1}$, we use the Euclidean algorithm. We need to find $\\gcd(S_n, S_{n+1}) = \\gcd(2^n - 1, 2^{n+1} - 1)$. Using the property of GCD that $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(a, b-a)$, we can simplify this to:\n$$\gcd(2^n - 1, 2^{n+1} - 1) = \\gcd(2^n - 1, (2^{n+1} - 1) - (2^n - 1)) = \\gcd(2^n - 1, 2^{n+1} - 2^n) = \\gcd(2^n - 1, 2^n(2 - 1)) = \\gcd(2^n - 1, 2^n).\n$$\nSince $2^n$ is a power of $2$ and thus only has factors of $2$, and $2^n - 1$ is odd (it lacks factors of $2$), their GCD must be $1$. However, this simplification ignores a subtle detail: if we express it as $\\gcd(2^n - 1, 2(2^n - 1) + 1)$, we get $\\gcd(2^n - 1, 1)$ which is clearly $1$ unless there's another factor in common. By closer inspection of $2^{n+1} - 1 = 2(2^n - 1) + 1$, it's clear that the only common factor between these two expressions for any $n$ is indeed just $1$, unless $n=1$ where both are $1$ giving GCD of $1$. So the largest possible value of the GCD is $1$.",

Reasoning:
To maximize the volume of the remaining block, we need to minimize the total volume of the slices removed. Given that each slice has a volume of \(1 \text{ cm}^2 \times \text{length}\) and can be cut parallel to any of the three faces, the minimum removal would involve cutting slices such that they do not overlap and remove as little volume as possible.

The dimensions of the cheese block are \(10 \text{ cm} \times 13 \text{ cm} \times 14 \text{ cm}\).

Each slice has a width of \(1 \text{ cm}\), so the maximum volume each slice can take is the area of the face it is cut from times its width (1 cm). If we cut all slices parallel to the same face, the volume removed per slice will be minimal if distributed across different faces:

1. Cutting 10 slices parallel to the \(10 \text{ cm} \times 13 \text{ cm}\) face, each slice has an area of \(10 \times 13 = 130 \text{ cm}^2\).
2. Cutting 10 slices parallel to the \(10 \text{ cm} \times 14 \text{ cm}\) face, each slice has an area of \(10 \times 14 = 140 \text{ cm}^2\).
3. Cutting 10 slices parallel to the \(13 \text{ cm} \times 14 \text{ cm}\) face, each slice has an area of \(13 \times 14 = 182 \text{ cm}^2\).

To minimize the total volume removed, distribute the slices so that the smallest faces are utilized first:

- Cut 10 slices parallel to the \(10 \text{ cm} \times 13 \text{ cm}\) face:
  - Volume removed per slice = \(1 \text{ cm} \times 130 \text{ cm}^2 = 130 \text{ cm}^3\)
  - Total volume removed = \(10 \times 130 \text{ cm}^3 = 1300 \text{ cm}^3\)

Therefore, the remaining volume is:
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = V_{\text{original}} - V_{\text{removed}} \]
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = (10 \times 13 \times 14) - 1300 \]
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = 1820 \text{ cm}^3 - 1300 \text{ cm}^3 \]
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = 520 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Alternatively, considering a different distribution where some slices use the larger face:
- Minimize usage on the largest face:
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = (10 \times 13 \times 14) - (10 \times 182 \text{ cm}^2 \times 1 \text{ cm}) \]
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = 1820 \text{ cm}^3 - 1820 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Thus, optimal strategy minimizes to:
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = 1820 \text{ cm}^3 - 10 \times 130 \text{ cm}^3 \]
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = 1820 \text{ cm}^3 - 1300 \text{ cm}^3 \]
\[ V_{\text{remaining}} = 520 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Thus, the maximum possible volume of the remaining block of cheese is \(1820 \text{ cm}

  "reasoning": "We can use the identity $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab+bc+ca)$. Given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 13$ and $ab + bc + ca = 6$, we substitute these values into the identity to find $(a+b+c)^2$. Thus, $(a+b+c)^2 = 13 + 2(6) = 25$.

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 96. Extracted: {
  "reasoning": "The angle labeled $150^\circ$ is an external angle to the triangle formed by the lines extending from the vertex at $(0,0)$. In any triangle, the sum of internal angles is $180^\circ$. The two other angles in this triangle with the vertex at $(0,0)$ form a straight line with the given $150^\circ$ angle, making their sum equal to $180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ$. Because these two angles are symmetrically placed and because the triangle is vertically bisected by the vertical line through the origin, each of them must be $15^\circ$. The angle $x$ is the supplementary angle to the sum of these two angles, so it is $180^\circ - 2 \times 15^\circ = 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ - (180^\circ - 150^\circ) = 30^\circ$.",

Warning: Could not find any JSON in the response for question 97. Response: {"reasoning": "To find the smallest three-digit positive integer that is congruent to 1 modulo 7, we need to identify the smallest number greater than or equal to 100 which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.\n\nWe can start by checking the remainder when 100 is divided by 7:\n\n\(100 \\div 7 = 14\) with a remainder of 2.\n\nThis means \(100 \\equiv 2 \mod 7\). To get a remainder of 1, we need to add enough to reach the next multiple of 7 and then add 1 more. Since the remainder is currently 2, we subtract 2 from 100 and then add 5 (since \(7 - 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\)), effectively adding 5 to reach the next number that would give us the desired remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, \(100 + 5 = 105 -
