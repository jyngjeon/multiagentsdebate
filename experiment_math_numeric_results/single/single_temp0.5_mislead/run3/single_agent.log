\[ -b^2 + 6b + 7 = 0 \]

Solve the quadratic equation \( -b^2 + 6b + 7 = 0 \):
\[ b^2 - 6b - 7 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \), where \( A = 1 \), \( B = -6 \), and \( C = -7 \):
\[ b = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 28}}{2} \]
\[ b = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2} \]
\[ b = \frac{6 \pm 8}{2} \]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[ b = \frac{6 + 8}{2} = 7 \]
\[ b = \frac{6 - 8}{2} = -1 \quad (\text{not valid as } b > 1) \]

Thus, the valid solution is:
\[ b = 7 \]

Therefore, the value of the base \( b \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 11. Extracted: {Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2^2) = 4\pi \]

Given that the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[ \text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]

The shaded region consists of two segments from the larger circle and one segment from the smaller circle. Let's denote the central angle \( \theta \) (in radians) corresponding to these segments. 

The area of a sector of a circle with radius \( r \) and central angle \( \theta \) is given by:
\[ \text{Sector Area} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta \]

For the larger circle with radius 2:
\[ \text{Larger Circle Sector Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta \]

For the smaller circle with radius 1:
\[ \text{Smaller Circle Sector Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2} \]

The area of a segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the endpoints of the arc. However, since the exact calculation involves complex geometry, we can use the given information directly.

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two sectors of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle sector:
\[ \text{Shaded Area} = 2\theta + 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = 4\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{8\theta - \theta}{2} = \frac{7\theta}{2} \]

We know the shaded area is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[ \frac{7\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]
\[ 7\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3} \]
\[ \theta = \frac{10\pi}{21} \]

Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:
\[ \theta = \frac{10\pi}{21} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{1800^\circ}{21} \approx 85.71^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[ \boxed{85.71}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 19. Extracted: {Height} = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \text{ cm}. \]

Thus, the large triangle has a base of 9 cm and a height of 8 cm.

Next, consider the smaller right triangle within the larger triangle, which has a base of 3 cm and shares the same height as the larger triangle (8 cm).

Now, let's calculate the areas of these triangles:

- Area of the large triangle:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{large}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 8 = 36 \text{ square cm}. \]

- Area of the smaller triangle:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 8 = 12 \text{ square cm}. \]

Finally, the shaded area is the difference between the area of the large triangle and the area of the smaller triangle:
\[ \text{Shaded area} = \text{Area}_{\text{large}} - \text{Area}_{\text{small}} = 36 - 12 = 24 \text{ square cm}. \]

Thus, the number of square centimeters in the shaded area is:
\[ \boxed{24}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 28. Extracted: {n+2}=z_{n+1}^2z_n$ for all integers $n \geq 1$.
- $\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}$ is real for all integers $n \geq 1$.
- $\left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = 2$.

We need to find the product of all possible values of $z_1$.

First, let's use the recursive relation to express some terms in the sequence:
\[ z_3 = z_2^2 z_1 \]
\[ z_4 = z_3^2 z_2 = (z_2^2 z_1)^2 z_2 = z_2^4 z_1^2 z_2 = z_2^5 z_1^2 \]
\[ z_5 = z_4^2 z_3 = (z_2^5 z_1^2)^2 (z_2^2 z_1) = z_2^{10} z_1^4 z_2^2 z_1 = z_2^{12} z_1^5 \]

Next, we use the given magnitude conditions:
\[ \left|\frac{z_3}{z_4}\right| = \left|\frac{z_2^2 z_1}{z_2^5 z_1^2}\right| = \left|\frac{z_1}{z_2^3 z_1}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{z_2^3}\right| = 2 \implies |z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \implies |z_2| = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ \left|\frac{z_4}{z_5}\right| = \left|\frac{z_2^5 z_1^2}{z_2^{12} z_1^5}\right| = \left|\frac{z_1^2}{z_2^7 z_1^5}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{z_2^7 z_1^3}\right| = 2 \implies |z_2|^7 |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since $|z_2|^3 = \frac{1}{2}$, we have $|z_2|^7 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{7}{3}} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Substituting this into the second equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \implies |z_1|^3 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}} = \frac{4}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{4}{3}}} = 4 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{3}} = 2^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{3}} = 2^{\frac{10}{3}} \implies |z_1| = 2^{\frac{10}{9}} \]

Now, consider the condition that $\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}$ is real for all $n \geq 1$. This implies that the argument of $\frac{z_{n+3}}{z_n^2}$ must be an integer multiple of $\pi$. Specifically, for $n=1$:
\[ \arg\left(\frac{z_4}{z_1^2}\right) = \arg(z_4) - 2\arg(z_1) = \arg(z_2^5 z_1^2) - 2\arg(z_1) = 5\arg(z_2) + 2\arg(z_1) - 2\arg(z_1) = 5\arg(z_2) \]
Since $\arg(z_2)$ is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, $5\arg(z_2)$ must be an integer multiple of $\pi$. Thus, $\arg(z_2) = k\pi/5$ for some integer $k$.

The possible values of $z_2$ are $e^{i\pi k/5}$ where $k$ is an odd integer (since $z_2$ is not real). Similarly, $\arg(z_1)$ must be such that $2\arg(z_1) - 5\arg(z_2)$ is an integer multiple of $\pi$. Given $|z_1| = 2^{\frac{10}{9}}$, the possible values of $z_1$ are $2^{\frac{10}{9}} e^{i\theta}$ where $\theta = m\pi/5$ for some integer $m$.

The product of all possible values of $z_1$ is:
\[ \prod_{m=0}^{4} 2^{\frac{10}{9}} e^{i\frac{m\pi}{5}} = 2^{\frac{50}{9}} e^{i\frac{10\pi}{5}} = 2^{\frac{50}{9}} e^{2i\pi} = 2^{\frac{50}{9}} \]

Thus, the product of all possible values of $z_1$ is:
\[ \boxed{32}

& \times & & P_b \\
\cline{2-4}
& & 3 & 1_b \\
\end{array} \]

Here, \( P \) and \( b \) are digits where \( P = b - 1 \).

First, let's express the multiplication in terms of base \( b \):

\[ (P_b \times P_b) = 31_b \]

In decimal form, this can be written as:

\[ (b - 1)(b - 1) = 3b + 1 \]

Expanding the left side:

\[ (b - 1)^2 = b^2 - 2b + 1 \]

So, we have:

\[ b^2 - 2b + 1 = 3b + 1 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ b^2 - 2b = 3b \]

Rearrange the equation:

\[ b^2 - 5b = 0 \]

Factor out \( b \):

\[ b(b - 5) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ b = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad b = 5 \]

Since \( b \) is a base and cannot be zero, we discard \( b = 0 \). Therefore, the valid solution is:

\[ b = 5 \]

Thus, the value of the base \( b \) is:

\[ \boxed{5}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 55. Extracted: {pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, let's compute the left-hand side of the equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We equate this to the right-hand side:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\ ac + dc & bc + d^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c & a \\ d & b \end{pmatrix}.
\]

This gives us four equations:
1. \( a^2 + bc = c \)
2. \( ab + bd = a \)
3. \( ac + dc = d \)
4. \( bc + d^2 = b \)

Let's analyze these equations one by one.

### Equation 1: \( a^2 + bc = c \)
Rewriting, we get:
\[ a^2 + bc - c = 0 \]
\[ a^2 + c(b-1) = 0 \]
\[ c(b-1) = -a^2 \quad \text{(Equation 1')} \]

### Equation 2: \( ab + bd = a \)
Factoring out \(b\) from the left-hand side:
\[ b(a + d) = a \]
If \(b \neq 0\), then:
\[ a + d = \frac{a}{b} \]
\[ b(a + d) = a \implies a + bd = a \implies bd = 0 \]
Thus, either \(b = 0\) or \(d = 0\).

### Equation 3: \( ac + dc = d \)
Factoring out \(c\) from the left-hand side:
\[ c(a + d) = d \]
If \(c \neq 0\), then:
\[ a + d = \frac{d}{c} \]
\[ c(a + d) = d \implies ac + dc = d \implies ac + d(c-1) = 0 \]
Thus, either \(c = 0\) or \(a + d = 0\).

### Equation 4: \( bc + d^2 = b \)
Rewriting, we get:
\[ bc + d^2 - b = 0 \]
\[ bc + d^2 - b = 0 \]
\[ b(c-1) + d^2 = 0 \quad \text{(Equation 4')} \]

Now, we consider different cases based on \(b\) and \(c\):

#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
From Equation 2:
\[ ab + bd = a \implies 0 = a \implies a = 0 \]

From Equation 4':
\[ b(c-1) + d^2 = 0 \implies 0(c-1) + d^2 = 0 \implies d^2 = 0 \implies d = 0 \]

From Equation 1':
\[ c(b-1) = -a^2 \implies c(-1) = -0 \implies c = 0 \]

So, one solution is \((a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 0, 0)\).

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
From Equation 3:
\[ c(a + d) = d \implies 0 = d \implies d = 0 \]

From Equation 4':
\[ b(c-1) + d^2 = 0 \implies b(-1) + 0 = 0 \implies b = 0 \]

From Equation 1':
\[ c(b-1) = -a^2 \implies 0(-1) = -a^2 \implies a^2 = 0 \implies a = 0 \]

So, another solution is \((a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 0, 0)\).

#### Case 3: \(b \neq 0\) and \(c \neq 0\)
From Equation 2:
\[ b(a + d) = a \implies a + d = \frac{a}{b} \implies d = \frac{a(1-b)}{b} \]

From Equation 3:
\[ c(a + d) = d \implies c \left(a + \frac{a(1-b)}{b}\right) = \frac{a(1-b)}{b} \]
\[ c \left(\frac{ab + a(1-b)}{b}\right) = \frac{a(1-b)}{b} \]
\[ c \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \frac{a(1-b)}{b} \]
\[ c = 1 - b \]

From Equation 1':
\[ c(b-1) = -a^2 \implies (1-b)(b-1) = -a^2 \implies -(b-1)^2 = -a^2 \implies (b-1)^2 = a^2 \]
\[ a = b-1 \text{ or } a = -(b-1) \]

Substituting back into \(d\):
\[ d = \frac{(b-1)(1-b)}{b} = \frac{-(b-1)^2}{b} = -\frac{(b-1)^2}{b} \]
\[ d = \frac{-(b-1)(1-b)}{b} = \frac{(b-1)^2}{b} \]

Thus, we have two solutions:
\[ (a, b, c, d) = (b-1, b, 1-b, -\frac{(b-1)^2}{b}) \]
\[ (a, b, c, d) = (-(b-1), b, 1-b, \frac{(b-1)^2}{b}) \]

Since \(b\) can take any non-zero real value, there are infinitely many solutions.

Combining all cases, we conclude that there are infinitely many solutions.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\infty}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 64. Extracted: {1}{2}\pi r^2\).

Given:
- The largest semicircle has a diameter of 16 cm, so its radius \(r_1\) is 8 cm.
- The next semicircle has a diameter of 12 cm, so its radius \(r_2\) is 6 cm.
- The third semicircle has a diameter of 8 cm, so its radius \(r_3\) is 4 cm.
- The smallest semicircle has a diameter of 4 cm, so its radius \(r_4\) is 2 cm.

We are asked to find the total area of the two shaded regions. Let's denote the areas of the semicircles as follows:
- Area of the largest semicircle (radius 8 cm): \(A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (8)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 64 = 32\pi\)
- Area of the second largest semicircle (radius 6 cm): \(A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (6)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 36 = 18\pi\)
- Area of the third semicircle (radius 4 cm): \(A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 16 = 8\pi\)
- Area of the smallest semicircle (radius 2 cm): \(A_4 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 4 = 2\pi\)

Now, let's identify the shaded regions:
- The first shaded region is the area of the largest semicircle minus the area of the second largest semicircle.
- The second shaded region is the area of the third semicircle minus the area of the smallest semicircle.

Calculate these areas:
\[ \text{First shaded region} = A_1 - A_2 = 32\pi - 18\pi = 14\pi \]
\[ \text{Second shaded region} = A_3 - A_4 = 8\pi - 2\pi = 6\pi \]

Total shaded area:
\[ \text{Total shaded area} = 14\pi + 6\pi = 20\pi \]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[ 20\pi \approx 20 \times 3.14 = 62.8 \]

Thus, the total area of the two shaded regions is approximately:
\[ \boxed{62.8}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 68. Extracted: {13} = w$ and $w^{11} = z$, we can substitute the first equation into the second to get $(z^{13})^{11} = z$. This simplifies to $z^{143} = z$. Since $z \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $z$ to get $z^{142} = 1$. Therefore, $z$ is a 142nd root of unity.

Since $142 = 2 \times 71$, the 142nd roots of unity are given by $e^{2k\pi i / 142}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 141$. The imaginary part of $z$ is then $\sin(2k\pi / 142) = \sin(k\pi / 71)$ for some integer $k$.

We need to find the value of $n$ such that the imaginary part of $z$ is $\sin(m\pi/n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. From the above, it's clear that $n = 71$ since $\sin(k\pi/71)$ is in its simplest form when $k$ and $71$ are coprime (which they are for most values of $k$).

Therefore, the answer is:

     But since \(x > 7\), this solution is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the setup.
   
   - Correctly, we should use vector addition:
     \[
     \overrightarrow{AB} = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)
     \]
     \[
     \overrightarrow{AC} = (7-5, 4-3) = (2, 1)

     To find \(\overrightarrow{AD}\):
     \[

     Adding \(\overrightarrow{AD}\) to \(A(5, 3)\):
     \[
     D = (5 + 1, 3 - 4) = (6, -1)
     \]
     This does not satisfy \(x > 7\).

   - Instead, consider:
     \[
     \overrightarrow{AD} = \overrightarrow{BC} = (7-6, 4-8) = (1, -4)
     \]
     Adding to \(A(5, 3)\):
     \[
     D = (5 + 1, 3 - 4) = (6, -1)
     \]
     Again, incorrect. Recheck:
     \[
     \overrightarrow{AD} = \overrightarrow{BC} = (7-6, 4-8) = (1, -4)
     \]
     Correctly:
     \[
     D = (7 + 1, 4 - 4) = (8, 0)
     \]

Thus, the correct coordinates are \(D(8, 0)\).

Therefore, \(x + y = 8 + 0 = 8\).

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 75. Extracted: {\tan x}{\sec x + 1} - \frac{\sec x - 1}{\tan x}\), we will use trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation.

First, recall that:
\[ \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}, \]
\[ \sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}. \]

Let's rewrite the given expression using these identities:
\[ \frac{\tan x}{\sec x + 1} - \frac{\sec x - 1}{\tan x} = \frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1}{\cos x} + 1} - \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x} - 1}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}. \]

Simplify each term separately:
\[ \frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1}{\cos x} + 1} = \frac{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1 + \cos x}{\cos x}} = \frac{\sin x}{1 + \cos x}. \]

For the second term:
\[ \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x} - 1}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}} = \frac{\frac{1 - \cos x}{\cos x}}{\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}} = \frac{1 - \cos x}{\sin x}. \]

Now, combine the simplified terms:
\[ \frac{\sin x}{1 + \cos x} - \frac{1 - \cos x}{\sin x}. \]

Next, find a common denominator:
\[ \frac{\sin^2 x - (1 - \cos x)(1 + \cos x)}{(1 + \cos x) \sin x}. \]

Simplify the numerator:
\[ \sin^2 x - (1 - \cos^2 x) = \sin^2 x - 1 + \cos^2 x. \]

Recall the Pythagorean identity:
\[ \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1. \]

Thus,
\[ \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x - 1 = 0. \]

Therefore, the numerator simplifies to zero:
\[ \frac{0}{(1 + \cos x) \sin x} = 0. \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 0. \]

Thus, the solution in JSON format is:
{"reasoning": "Simplified the expression using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation, resulting in a numerator of zero.", "answer": 0}

Warning: Failed to decode the extracted JSON for question 87. Extracted: {10^9}{k}\) is less than \(\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\).

First, recall the definition of binomial coefficients:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
We want to compare \(\binom{10^9}{k}\) and \(\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\):
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} = \frac{10^9!}{k!(10^9-k)!}
\]
\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \frac{(10^9 + 1)!}{(k-1)!(10^9 + 2 - k)!}
\]

Using the property of factorials, we can express \(\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}\) in terms of \(\binom{10^9}{k-1}\):
\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \frac{(10^9 + 1)}{(10^9 + 2 - k)} \cdot \binom{10^9}{k - 1}
\]

Next, we need to compare \(\binom{10^9}{k}\) and \(\binom{10^9}{k-1}\). Using the relationship between consecutive binomial coefficients:
\[
\binom{10^9}{k} = \frac{10^9 - (k-1)}{k} \cdot \binom{10^9}{k-1}
\]

Thus, we need:
\[
\frac{10^9 - (k-1)}{k} \cdot \binom{10^9}{k-1} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 + 2 - k} \cdot \binom{10^9}{k-1}
\]

Since \(\binom{10^9}{k-1}\) is common on both sides, we can cancel it out:
\[
\frac{10^9 - (k-1)}{k} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 + 2 - k}
\]

Simplify the inequality:
\[
\frac{10^9 - k + 1}{k} < \frac{10^9 + 1}{10^9 + 2 - k}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
(10^9 - k + 1)(10^9 + 2 - k) < k(10^9 + 1)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
(10^9)^2 + 2 \cdot 10^9 - 10^9 k + 10^9 + 2 - k - k \cdot 10^9 - 2k + k^2 < 10^9 k + k
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
10^{18} + 3 \cdot 10^9 + 2 - 2k \cdot 10^9 - 3k + k^2 < 10^9 k + k
\]

Rearrange all terms to one side:
\[
10^{18} + 3 \cdot 10^9 + 2 - 2k \cdot 10^9 - 3k + k^2 - 10^9 k - k < 0
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
10^{18} + 3 \cdot 10^9 + 2 - 3k \cdot 10^9 - 4k + k^2 < 0
\]

For large \( n \), the dominant term is \( k^2 \approx 3k \cdot 10^9 \). Solving approximately:
\[
k \approx \frac{3 \cdot 10^9}{2} = 1.5 \times 10^9
\]

Thus, the smallest integer \( k \) is \( 1500000000 \).

The first digit \( a \) is 1, and the second digit \( b \) is 5. Therefore:
\[
10a + b = 10 \cdot 1 + 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
